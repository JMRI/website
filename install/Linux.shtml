  <h1>JMRI Install Guide: Linux</h1>

    <h2>General JMRI Linux Install Procedure</h2>

    <p>The following steps provide general instructions for installing JMRI on Linux using the
    terminal command line along with brief GUI descriptions for some activities. It should work for
    most Debian and Red Hat based distributions.  It has been tested on Mint 20.3, Ubuntu 22.04,
    Debian 11, Raspberry Pi OS, CentOS 9, and Fedora 38.  The serial connectons have been tested
    using the RR-CirKits <em>LCC Buffer-USB</em>.</p>

    <p>Note: The instructions use the standard tilde (~) shortcut to represent the users's home
    directory at <strong><em>/home/&lt;username&gt;</em></strong>.

    <h3>Install Java</h3>

    <p>Starting with JMRI 5.0, the minimum required Java version was Java 11. JMRI 5 will not work
    with Java versions below Java 11. Starting with JMRI 5.9.1, Java 17 is the recommended version.
    See <a href="../java/index.shtml#linux_java">Using Java with JMRI</a> for installing Java.</p>

    <h3>Serial Port Access</h3>

    <p>The majority of JMRI layout connections are based on serial ports.  On recent hardware these
    are implemented using USB ports and a USB device such as the RR-CirKits <em>LCC Buffer-USB</em>.
    Most USB serial devices do not require the installation of drivers.  The Linux user running JMRI
    needs to have <strong>read/write</strong> access to the serial ports. The following command
    updates the user's group list with access to the serial ports.</p>

    <code>sudo usermod -a -G dialout ${USER}</code>

    <p>Do not change ${USER}.  That is a variable that contains the current user name.  Note: You 
    will need to logout and log back in after running the usermod command for it to take affect.</p>

    <h3>Download JMRI</h3>

    <p>The JMRI Linux install package is a tar gzip file, <strong>tgz</strong>.  Click on
    <a href="../download/index.shtml#prod-rel">Download</a>.  This will redirect the browser to the
    latest production download page.  Click on the link for the Linux file.  If a different version,
    such as a test release, is desired, use the links in the sidebar to select the release note for
    that version.</p>

    <p>While at the download page, it is good idea to read the release note about the changes and
    any warnings.</p>

    <h3>Install JMRI</h3>

    <p>The JMRI package is a complete JMRI implementation.  There is no upgrade process. Any existing
    installs should be removed or renamed.</p>

    <p>If custom components have been added to a JMRI install, they will need to be copied somewhere
    safe before removing an old version.  To minimize the risk of losing custom components, they
    should be in the <strong>user files location</strong>.  Profiles and other user data is in the
    <strong>~/.jmri</strong> directory.</p>

    <p>The recommended install location is the user's <strong><em>home</em></strong> directory.
    This reduces the possibility of OS or other application issues.  The <strong>tar</strong> command is used to
    extract the JMRI directory.</p>

    <code>tar xzf &lt;file name&gt; -C ~</code>

    <p>Replace <strong><em>&lt;file name&gt;</em></strong> with the downloaded file name. The
    <strong><em>-C ~</em></strong> writes the output to the home directory.</p>

    <div class="noted">
      <p>The <strong>tar</strong> command works on all Linux distributions.  Most distributions also
      have a GUI tool to expand compressed tar files.  This is accessed using the file manager right
      click context menu for the downloaded tar file.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Mint</dt>
        <dd>
          <p><strong>Open With Archive Manager</strong> &mdash; When the archive opens, click on
          <strong>Extract</strong>.  The next page is used to select the destination, such as
          <strong>Home</strong>.  Then click on <strong>Extract</strong>.</p>

          <p><strong>Extract Here</strong> &mdash; Extracts JMRI to the current location. Move the
          extracted JMRI directory to the desired location.  An alternate method is to move the
          downloaded file first and then do the <strong>Extract Here</strong>.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Ubuntu</dt>
        <dd>
          <p><strong>Open With Archive Manager</strong> &mdash; Same as Mint.</p>

          <p><strong>Extract Here</strong> &mdash; Extracts JMRI to the current location but within
          a new directory.  Open the directory and move the extracted JMRI directory to the desired
          location.</p>

          <p><strong>Extract To...</strong> &mdash; After selecting a destination location such as
          <strong>Home</strong>, extracts JMRI within a new directory.  Open the directory and move
          the extracted JMRI directory to the desired location.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>CentOS</dt>
        <dd>
          <p><strong>Extract Here</strong> &mdash; Same as Ubuntu.</p>

          <p><strong>Extract To...</strong> &mdash; Same as Ubuntu.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Raspberry Pi OS</dt>
        <dd>
          <p><strong>Archiver</strong> &mdash; After the JMRI tar file is loaded, click on
          <strong>JMRI</strong> and then the Extract files <strong>icon</strong>.  Select the
          destination such as <strong>Home</strong> and click on <strong>Open</strong>.  Then click
          on <strong>Extract</strong>.</p>

          <p><strong>Extract Here</strong> &mdash; Same as Mint.</p>

          <p><strong>Extract To...</strong> &mdash; After selecting a destination location such as
          <strong>Home</strong>, click on <strong>Open</strong>.  Then click on <strong>Extract</strong>.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

    <h4>Application Icons</h4>
      <p>Application icons are not required.  PanelPro and DecoderPro can be started by clicking on
      the scripts within the JMRI install in the file manager or from the command line.  For example:
      <code>~/JMRI/PanelPro</code></p>

      <p>As of the <strong><em>JMRI 5.3.6</em></strong> test release, the <strong>CreateJmriApps.sh
      </strong> shell script is included in Linux JMRI install.  The script creates Linux application
      definitions for DecoderPro and PanelPro.  These are used by Linux application launchers such
      as the LM popup in Mint, the Raspberry popup in Raspberry Pi OS, the application grids, etc.
      These are stored in <strong>~/.local/share/applications</strong>.  The script will also create
      desktop icons if the <strong>--desktop</strong> or the <strong>-d</strong> option is included
      when running the script using the terminal command line, e.g.
      <code>~/JMRI/CreateJmriApps.sh --desktop</code>.</p>

      <p>For earlier versions of JMRI, the script can be downloaded from the JMRI Users Group at
      <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/files/Script%20examples/CreateJmriApps.sh">
      CreateJmriApps.sh</a>.
      After downloading the script, move it to JMRI program directory and change the permissions
      to make it executable: <code>chmod +x ~/JMRI/CreateJmriApps.sh</code>.</p>

      <p>Use the following instructions if the script is not available, not suitable or a personal
      preference.</p>

      <h5>Mint</h5>

      <p>Use the <strong>Create a new launcher here...</strong> desktop action.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Right click on the desktop and select <strong>Create a new launcher here...</strong>.</li>
        <li>Enter the icon name.</li>
        <li>Use the <strong>Browse</strong> button to select the PanelPro or DecoderPro script in
        the JMRI directory.</li>
        <li>The Comment is optional.</li>
        <li>Leave <strong>Launch in Terminal</strong> unchecked.</li>
        <li>Click on the icon.</li>
        <li>Use the <strong>Browse</strong> button to find the icon in <strong>JMRI/resources</strong>.</li>
        <li>After selecting the icon, click on the icon in pallet and click on <strong>Select</strong>.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>OK</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <p>Note:  The following technique also works for Mint.</p>

      <h5>Others</h5>

        <h6>Define Applications</h6>

        <p>Custom Linux applications,such as DecoderPro and PanelPro, are defined by a <strong>
        <em>&lt;name&gt;.desktop</em></strong> file in <strong>~/.local/share/applications</strong>.
        The files are used by the standard application launchers.  These are normally a popup menu
        accessed by an icon such as the Mint LM or an application grid based launcher.</p>

        <p>The definitions are data for the application launcher system so they do not need to be
        executable.  Since they are in a hidden directory, enable the <strong><em>Show Hidden Files
        </em></strong> file manager preference.</p>

        <h6>Desktop Icons</h6>

        <p>Desktop icons are defined by the same <strong><em>&lt;name&gt;.desktop</em></strong> file,
        but are located in <strong>~/Desktop</strong>.  These files need to be executable.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Right click on the icon and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
          <li>Select the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab.</li>
          <li>Enable <strong>Allow executing file as program</strong></li>
          <li>Click on <strong>Close</strong></li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some distributions will also need <strong>Allow Launching</strong> enabled in the right click menu.</p>


      <h5>File Content</h5>
      <dl>
        <dt>DecoderPro.desktop</dt>
        <dd><pre>
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=DecoderPro
Comment=JMRI Decoder Pro
Icon=/home/&lt;username&gt;/JMRI/resources/decoderpro.gif
Exec=/home/&lt;username&gt;/JMRI/DecoderPro
Terminal=false;
        </pre></dd>

        <dt>PanelPro.desktop</dt>
        <dd><pre>
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=PanelPro
Comment=JMRI Panel Pro
Icon=/home/&lt;username&gt;/JMRI/resources/PanelPro.gif
Exec=/home/&lt;username&gt;/JMRI/PanelPro
Terminal=false;
        </pre></dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Change <strong>&lt;username&gt;</strong> to the actual user name.</p>

      <h5>Application Options</h5>

      <p>For distributions that use a "start menu" style popup menu, the JMRI applications will be
      in the <strong>Other</strong> group.  The right click menu may have options.  For example,
      Mint has an option to place the icon on the task bar panel.</p>

      <p>For distributions that use an application grid, the application grid is displayed by clicking on the
      3x3 application grid icon.  The JMRI icon will show in the dock while the application is
      running and then go away when JMRI is stopped.  The JMRI application icon can be added to the
      dock as a favorite by doing a right click on the JMRI icon in the application grid and
      selecting <strong>Add to Favorites</strong>.</p>

      <p class="noted">The icon setup only needs to be done on the first install.  The icons will
      continue to work when the JMRI install directory is replaced by a new download and extract.</p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <p>The JMRI user data is located at <strong>~/.jmri</strong>.  This is a hidden directory.  Some
    applications ignore hidden directories.  The Linux file manager normally has an option to make
    the hidden directories visible.  A symbolic link can be used to provide a substitute reference.
    At the home directory, enter <code>ln -s .jmri jmri</code> in a terminal window.

    <p>The JMRI project is continuously adding features, bug fixes, examples and tutorials to the
    release, and so new "test" versions appear about once a month.  These are announced in the
    "JMRI users" Groups.io discussion group at
    <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">https://groups.io/g/jmriusers</a>.

    <p>Additional information can be found at the "<a href="FAQLinux.html">JMRI Linux FAQ page</a>".
