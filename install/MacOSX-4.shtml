  <p>Now, on to the show:</p>

      <a id="installation"></a><h2>Installing JMRI 3 or 4 on an OS X computer</h2>

      <ol>
       <li><a id="sysreq"></a>
       Determine if your system software is compatible with the 4.x releases of JMRI:
       Find the current OS X version number by choosing "About this Mac" from the Apple menu.

       <ul>
       <li>
       JMRI 4.x and later will work on any macOS or OS X version back to 10.7.3 Lion (2012).<br>
       Note that OS X Lion 10.7.1 and 10.7.2 will have to be updated to 10.7.3 to install JMRI 4.2.</li>

       <li>
       If your Mac hardware doesn't let you update OS X to a recent enough version to run Java 1.8,
       you can try to install a 3.x version of JMRI.<br>
       OS X version 10.7.2 "Lion" through 10.6 "Snow Leopard" can run
       <a href="http://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri3.10.1.shtml">JMRI 3.10.1</a> using Java 1.7.
       (The youngest Mac that can't run Mountain Lion was shipped in 2009)</li>

       <li>For even older hardware, see a <a href="MacOSXRetro.shtml">Early Mac OS X page</a>.</li>
       </ul>

       <p>JMRI 3.x - 4.x installs will take up about 330&nbsp;MB of disk space, mostly for the Help pages
       and decoder definitions.</p>
       </li>

        <li>Determine if you have the needed hardware drivers:

        <p>No Macintosh running macOS has built-in Serial
        Ports, so if your layout hardware needs a serial connection,
        you'll have to use a <a href="../help/en/html/hardware/USBtoSerial.shtml">USB-to-Serial adapter</a>.</p>

        <p>No matter if you have a USB-to-Serial adapter, or a device with a direct
        USB connection, you will need macOS drivers (system software) for the hardware you're using.
        Most hardware won't need a separate driver;
        they're already present in macOS.  In some cases you will need to install a special driver, though,
        so check the manufacturer's website to make sure.</p>

        <p><em>Note: OS X 10.11 El Capitan and later macOS versions generally require
        signed drivers. If you installed drivers for a previous version,
        particularly drivers that don't say they support OS X 10.10 Yosemite,
        those older drivers may not work with 10.11 El Capitan.  Go to the
        website for your USB adapter, download the newest driver and
        install it before you update to El Capitan, or right after updating before
        trying to run JMRI.</em>

        <p>
        For more instructions on USB connection debugging and testing for correct
        drivers, see the
        <a href="#usb">USB section</a> further down on this page.

        <p>
        We test using a Keyspan PDA Adapter; those drivers are available at
        <a href="http://www.keyspan.com/downloads/">
        http://www.keyspan.com/downloads/</a>. Some device drivers will list
        each port under several names, e.g. starting with "/dev/tty" or
        "/dev/cu", for example "/dev/tty.KeyUSA19181.1". In that case, you
        must select the one that starts with "cu", e.g.
        "/dev/cu.KeyUSA19181.1".</p>

        <p>OS X drivers for FTDI chipsets are available from
        <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm">FTDI</a>.

        <p>There's a macOS driver for USB-serial adapters
        based on the Prolific PL2303 chipset
        <a href="http://osx-pl2303.sourceforge.net/">available here</a>.
        If you can't access your USB dongle, and it seems to use that
        chipset (you can check in the USB tab of System Profiler),
        this driver will make it available as /dev/cu.PL2303-xxx.</p>
       </li>

       <li>Get the JMRI software...

        <p>Download <a href="../releasenotes/jmri4.26.shtml">JMRI 4.26</a>
        - or <a href="../releasenotes/jmri3.10.1.shtml">JMRI 3.10.1</a>. Since the version
        numbers change with every release, <a href="../download/index.shtml">this
        link</a> takes you to the general JMRI download page, where you can select
        whichever version you like.</p>

        <p>The JMRI project is continuously adding features, bug
        fixes, examples and tutorials to the release, and so a new
        "test" version appears every month or so. You may find one of
        these has features that you really want. These are announced
        in the JMRI users Groups.io group at <a
         href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">https://groups.io/g/jmriusers</a>.
        </p>
       </li>

       <li>...and install it.

        <p>Normally, the download will open a new Finder window showing a
        JMRI folder.  If not, double-click the file you downloaded
        above.  This should open a window with the JMRI folder.
        If that still doesn't open a window, look for a newly-mounted
        disk image (e.g. in Finder) and open that manually.</p>

        <p>To install, you just have to move the downloaded JMRI folder to where
        you want it on your computer. We recommend you put it in
        Applications, which is the standard location for this.  To
        do that, just drag the JMRI folder onto the "Applications"
        icon.</p>

        <p>If you want to keep it somewhere else, just drag the
        folder to the desired location.</p>

        <p>Note that on macOS Catalina and later, you won't be able
        to run JMRI from within the Downloads, Desktop or Documents
        folder, so we strongly recommend you drag the JMRI folder to
        Applications and run it from there.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>Depending on how your Mac is set up, you might need to
        install <strong>Java</strong>:
            <ul>
            <li>Let's try the easy way first.  Open the
                JMRI folder you just put in Applications, and
                double-click on DecoderPro.  If this starts up
                OK, you have Java installed.  Move to the next
                step.  If it opens a dialog box that offers
                to install Java, or takes you to the Java
                install website, just follow those instructions.
            </li>
            <li><a id="java11"></a>
                If that doesn't work, and you have a suitable
                macOS version to run JMRI 4.x (see above), your next step is to install
                Java 11.  To do that, click on
                <a href="https://repos.azul.com/azure-only/zulu/packages/zulu-11/11.0.13/zulu-11-azure-jre_11.52.13-11.0.13-macosx_x64.dmg">this
                download link</a>. A download should start shortly.
                When it's complete, click on the file and follow instructions to
                install Java.
                (That link is the same as the download link near the bottom of
                <a href="https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&os=macos&package=jre">this page on the Azul website</a>.)
                <br>
                JMRI 4 was developed with Java 8, but we now recommend that you run it using Java 11.
                It should work fine with any Java version from Java 8 to Java 14.
	            With some versions you may get a message about
	                "WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred"
	                and "WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers".
	            We know about this, and it'll get fixed in due course; you can ignore the messages.
	            Java 15 and later caused some problems, so please install and use
	            Java 11 with JMRI releases 4.
            </li>
            <li>
            If your hardware macOS version is limited to JMRI 3.x, your next step is to <a
                    href="https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">install
              Java JRE 1.8</a> (under Mac OS).
            </li>
            </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Congratulations! Installation is complete. Click on the DecoderPro icon in the
          JMRI folder to get started.
      </li>

      </ol>

      <a id="update"></a>
      <h2>Updating JMRI</h2>
          <p>If you already have JMRI installed and working, and want to update
          to a newer version, just:
          <ul>
          <li>Download the new version
          <li>Double-click on the downloaded file to open the disk image. That should open the
            contents in a new Finder window, but if not, open it.
          <li>Drag the new JMRI folder to the Applications icon to replace
            your existing version. If asked whether you want to do that, say OK.
          </ul>
          <p>Your existing configuration information, Panel files, etc. will
          continue to be used with the new version.

          <h3>Clean Install</h3>
          <p>If for any reason you wish to start totally clean and discard all previously stored Connections, Roster
          entries and Panels, delete the JMRI settings folder before starting the program. You will find it by choosing
          "Go to Folder..." from the Finder's <b>Go</b> menu (or &#8984;+Shift+G). In the pane that appears, enter
          "~/Library/Preferences/", click "Go". If a "JMRI" folder is present in Preferences, move it to the Trash.
          </p>

      <a id="startup"></a><h2>Starting JMRI</h2>

      <p>Connect your computer to your <a
         href="../help/en/html/hardware/index.shtml">Command Station
        hardware</a>.

      <p>You can run the program by double-clicking on the
        "DecoderPro" or "PanelPro" or other application icons in the
        JMRI folder.
      <p>
        Depending on your security settings, when you
        first try to run a new JMRI version (usually by double-clicking
        on the icon for DecoderPro or PanelPro), you may get a warning dialog
        that it "can't be opened because it's from an unidentified developer".
        In that case, dismiss the dialog, then hold the Control key
        down and click the icon to get its contextual menu. Select
        the "Open" option. You'll be asked to confirm. Be sure
        to click the "Open" button, and not accept the default "Cancel".</p>

       <p>
       Your next step will be to set the Preferences for your particular layout connection.
       More on this on the <a href="../help/en/html/setup/index.shtml">JMRI Setup help page</a>.
       Go there next to complete your setup.</p>

       <p> Mac OS uses names like "<code>cu.SomeName</code>" and
       "<code>tty.SomeName</code>" for devices, including
       USB-attached devices like USB-serial converters,
       LocoBuffer-USBs and similar.  Generally, you'll want to use the
       one that starts with "<code>cu.</code>" if both
       <code>cu.</code> and <code>tty.</code> are present, but
       see the specific installation page for your particular type of
       device.  Sometimes you can recognize your interface from the
       right-hand part of the name.  If not, the easiest way to find
       the name for your interface is to disconnect it, start JMRI,
       write down the list of available devices, close JMRI, reconnect
       the interface, start JMRI again, and look to see which extra
       name has appeared.  That's the name one you want.</p>

<a id="debug"></a><h2>Debugging</h2>

  <p>JMRI supports many different Mac computers,
  with several different kinds of processors,
  multiple macOS versions,
  and various layout hardware.
  Some combinations can cause trouble.
  This section gives some debugging hints.</p>

<a id="usb"></a><h3>USB Serial Issues</h3>

  <p>Irrespective of DCC system, there are some basic rules for troubleshooting any USB-attached device to a Mac.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plug your device into your Mac.

<li>Go to "System Information" from Apple Menu->About This Mac->More Info->System information.

<li>Look in the USB section, expand all sections under controllers
    and hubs and see what devices are present.

<li>Unplug your device, select Refresh from the System Information menus and see what
    device has disappeared. Plug your device back in, refresh again and see what reappears.
    Repeat until you see what is changing. If there is no change, there must be a hardware
    problem external to your Mac, such as a faulty USB cable, connector or device and
    there is no point going any further until your Mac can see the physical device.

<li>Once you have seen the device in System Information, (it should report the Manufacturer
     name, so you know where to go to get drivers) you will quite likely have to install
     Mac drivers for it (although some do not need extra drivers, see your documentation).
     If unsure, try the next step anyway.

<li>In High Sierra and above, you must open System Preferences->Privacy and Security and
    allow the kernel extensions (drivers) you installed to be loaded, or they will not be used.

<li>Unplug your device. Open a window of the  Terminal utility (from /Applications/Utilities),
    copy and paste the following command in EXACTLY (including spaces and punctuation) and then press Enter.
    <div class="wide">
        <code>
            while : ;do clear;ls -lt /dev|head;i=$((i+1));echo $i;sleep 1;done
        </code>
    </div>
    This command should show about 10 lines of output and then sit looping, with a counter incrementing every second.

<li>Plug your device back in and wait a few seconds. Two new items with names like  cu.xxx and tty.xxx should appear in the list.
    They should disappear if you unplug your device. If this does not happen,
    you do not have the correct drivers installed for your device, and you will
    need to solve that before proceeding further. Once you have found your device, write down the name you see.
You want the cu.xxx version not the <code>tty.xxx</code> version.

<li>If you have got this far you know your device is being seen by your Mac,
that it has a matching driver installed and the name of the connection port <code>cu.xxx</code> you need
    to select in JMRI. If you cannot get this far,
    there's no way JMRI can find your device until the driver issue is resolved.
</ul>

  <a id="notes"></a><h2>Notes</h2>

<a id="javase6"></a><h3>Remove Java SE 6</h3>
    <p>To check for Java SE 6, JMRI 4.5.2 and up include a script. Follow these steps (assuming
      JMRI is installed in the folder <em>/Applications/JMRI</em>; if it's installed in a different location, adjust the paths as needed):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <em>Terminal.app</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan and later:</em> Reboot into Recovery Mode by restarting your
          Mac and pressing Cmd-R until the Apple logo appears. Once in Recovery Mode,
          select Terminal from the Utilities menu.</p>
        </li>
      <li>Run the command
      <div class="wide">
          <code>
              /Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh
          </code>
      </div>
      It can take
        up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan and later:</em> Run the command
          <div class="wide">
              <code>
                  bash /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD
              </code>
          </div>
          It can take up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.
        </li>
      <li><em>El Capitan and later:</em> Restart your Mac.</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Vector3f issue</h3>
<p>
Sometimes very old Macs have an older "vecsub.jar" library installed in a place that
will cause problems for JMRI.  It happens more often when you're compiling your
own version, but it can also happen when just running a download. If you get messages about
<code>
error: cannot find symbol getX()
</code>
or getY() or getZ(), the solution is to copy the <code>JMRI/lib/vecmath-1.5.2.jar</code> file from
within the JMRI distribution directory to the  <code>~/Library/Java/Extensions/</code> directory.
(You might have to create that directory).
<u>Do not do this unless you have seen that symptom</u>.

<a id="catalina"></a><h3>macOS 10.15 Catalina</h3>

Starting in early Fall 2019, macOS 10.15 Catalina greatly increased the security checks
that macOS applications must pass before running.
<p>
Some issues:
<ul>
    <li>If you upgrade to Catalina on a computer with a working JMRI installation,
        it should continue to work. (If not, please let us know on the
        <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">jmriusers group</a>.)
    <li>If you installed Oracle's Java 8 before upgrading to Catalina, it'll still work.
        If you want to install Java 8 from Oracle onto a Catalina system,
        there are some
        <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/using-jdk-jre-macos-catalina-5781620.html">instructions on the Oracle website</a>.
        The Oracle Java 11 installer is an easier installation, and works fine with
        JMRI, so we recommend you do that instead.
    <li>JMRI versions before 4.17.5 are very hard to properly install on Catalina, and
        we don't recommend trying.
    <li>We hope to have JMRI 4.17.5 fully compatible with Catalina for new installs.
        To install JMRI 4.17.5 or later on Catalina, please drag the JMRI folder to the
        Applications folder.  Depending on your system security settings, dragging it to
        Downloads, Documents or Desktop might not work.
</ul>

<h3>Customizing your JMRI Installation</h3>

You might want to have more than one Configuration for DecoderPro
or PanelPro preset.  For example, you might to sometimes connect
PanelPro to the Command Station on your layout, or other times
have a configuration that doesn't use a layout connection, so you can
work with the program on a laptop away from the layout.

<p>
With macOS, JMRI makes this easy to do. PanelPro and DecoderPro save
their Preferences separately, so they can be configured independently.

<p>
On a Mac, the different Preferences files take their name from the name of the application icon that's invoked.
This lets you create multiple copies of e.g. DecoderPro that each use their own, separate Preferences files.
Let's say you want one called "CoolNewOne".
	<ul>
	<li>Duplicate the DecoderPro application icon (ctrl-click to get a popup menu and say duplicate,
	or select the icon and choose duplicate from the File menu in Finder).
	<li>Change the duplicate's name.
	(It's probably better to use a simple one-word name like "CoolNewOne")
	<li>Double-click your new icon, and off you go.
	</ul>

<p>
It won't work to drag one of the JMRI application icons out of the
JMRI folder, since they need the other files that can be found there.
If you want an icon in some other place, like on your desktop:

	<ul>
	<li>Go to the JMRI folder and select the application icon.
	<li>From the file menu, select "Make Alias"
	<li>Drag that new alias icon to its new location, and optionally rename it.
	</ul>

<p>
Note that renaming the alias alone does not cause the application icon to be renamed, so the alias will be using the
same Preferences as the original.
