    <dt>Operations for Modular Layouts using JMRI Switch Lists (Paul Bender)
        <dd>This clinic will discus how to use JMRI's OperationsPro software 
            to generate switch lists for a modular layout. Examples will come 
            from the Free-moN layout setup in conjunction with Operations Roadshow
            that will be running operating sessions during the convention. 
            We'll cover OperationsPro topics that are relevant to all layouts
            while also providing tricks and techniques that are specific to
            modular layouts that typically change every time they are assembled.
    <dt>Special effects on-layout lighting (Chuck Stancil)
        <dd>Overview of special effects lighting you can achieve using commercial products.
            Will show how to use and program, using LCC and DCC, the Light EFX-16 board
            from Logic Rail Technologies. A small diorama will be used to demonstrate 
            many of the possible effects. The element of time-based triggering of 
            lighting events will also be demonstrated.
