      Release Notes for JMRI 5.9.6 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: MM DDD, 2024</p>
    <p>From: release pumpkin</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.9.6 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.9.* test releases.
It requires at least Java 11 to work.
We recommend that you use Java 17.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI  production release in December 2024.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<!--
<P>We are getting close to the next production release, so we would particularly
appreciate your testing of this release to make sure it works for you. That way,
if you find new problems, we can try to fix them before the production release.</P>
 -->

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.
We would appreciate your feedback on it.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

        <h4>Lenz XPressNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Throttles are now fully released by JMRI when not required, which resolves an issue with
                Roster Last Operated and Operating Duration fields not being updated.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>LocoNet Monitor gives better information when some
                    responses were reporting "unrecognized message" for
                    CV reads of LocoNet-connected Digitrax 7th-generation
                    Accessory devices.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed a bug were immediate-mode sliders would sometimes
                    not automatically write their contents when changed,
                    leaving people to have to push the "Write" button.</li>
                <li>OpenLCB and LCC connections now support "DCC Signal Decoder"
                    Signal Heads.</li>
                <li>The OpenLCB and LCC implementations have started to provide a CommandStation
                    object with limited capability.</li>
                <li>STL Editor: Provide an alternate view where the IQYZ tables are in a separate
                    window. This makes it possible to see the table content while working on the
                    STL logic.</li>
                <li>STL Editor: Implement a view option to provide a preview of the generated
                    STL logic.</li>
                <li>STL Editor: Implement shift-click to copy a name from a table row to the current
                    logic row.</li>
                <li>Improved how UTF-8 is handled in CDI display.</li>
            </ul>


    <h3>New / Updated decoder definitions</h3>

        <h4>Digitrax</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Added new DH187, DH127 and DN167n18 models</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>SoundTraxx</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Athearn ECO & TSU2 add new models</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>TCS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The decoder definitions for the TCS WOW Steam version 4.6
                    <a href="https://groups.io/g/TCS-Users/message/14774">have been improved</a>.
                    </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Control Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="CPE" name="CPE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The "Scale" operation on icons has been
                changed to a relative scaling from the current size.
                For example, if you've scaled an icon by 150% already,
                and request a rescaling by 200%, the icon will end up
                at 300%.  Previously, this would work inconsistently.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>DecoderPro</h3>
        <a id="DecoderPro" name="DecoderPro"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>A problem where the Simple CV programmer would sometimes
                fail to display the proper options has been fixed.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Dispatcher</h3>
        <a id="Dispatcher" name="Dispatcher"></a>
        <ul>
             <li>Add minimum reliable operating throttle setting.
             Calculate adjusted throttle as throttle * factor then apply max and min limits.
             Use Max speed from the roster entry, if available, as default.
             Refactor ActivateTrain to push the final validation and train creation into dispatcher.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Layout Editor</h3>
        <a id="LE" name="LE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fix slip turnout control circle colors when using closed/thrown colors.</li>
            <li>The "Scale" operation on icons has been
                changed to a relative scaling from the current size.
                For example, if you've scaled an icon by 150% already,
                and request a rescaling by 200%, the icon will end up
                at 300%.  Previously, this would work inconsistently.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>OperationsPro</h3>
        <a id="Operations" name="Operations"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>New feature, you can now control which caboose road names a train can use.</li>
            <li>New tool, "Set Locomotives", allows you to change a group of locomotives.
        </ul>

   <h3>Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="PE" name="PE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The "Scale" operation on icons has been
                changed to a relative scaling from the current size.
                For example, if you've scaled an icon by 150% already,
                and request a rescaling by 200%, the icon will end up
                at 300%.  Previously, this would work inconsistently.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Preferences</h3>
        <a id="Preferences" name="Preferences"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Linux & Mac: When finding available serial ports, JMRI now looks for symbolic
              links in /dev even when the purejavacomm.portnamepattern system property is not specified.
              Such symlinks can be used to provide a stable filename for a USB serial port.  For instance:
              <pre>
              $ ls -l /dev/serial/by-id/
              total 0
              lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Nov  7 10:32 usb-RR-CirKits_LocoBuffer-USB_FTV8GN2E-if00-port0 -> ../../ttyUSB1
              $ sudo ln -s /dev/serial/by-id/usb-RR-CirKits_LocoBuffer-USB_FTV8GN2E-if00-port0 /dev/LocoBuffer
              </pre>
              Then the Preferences panel will present 'LocoBuffer' as an available serial port, and it will remain
              available even if the port is later mapped to ttyUSB2, etc.
            </li>
        </ul>
