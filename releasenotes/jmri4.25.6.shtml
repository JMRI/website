      Release Notes for JMRI 4.25.6 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: November 17, 2021</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.25.6 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release at the end of 2021.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.20, please follow these instructions carefully:
<!-- Note:  At this point, we're not requiring an update to 4.22; change if needed-->
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later relese.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<h3>New problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either
wait for
<a href="jmri4.25.7.shtml">JMRI 4.25.7</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        None yet
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.20.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.20 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.21 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>
installing this test release.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21.4.shtml">JMRI 4.21.4</a></span>
        If you use a Safari browser on macOS X, the local
        help system might not work.  There are two
        workarounds:
        <ol>
        <li>If your computer is connected to the internet, use
            the web-based help.  Go to JMRI Preferences, then
            select Help on the left, then click "Open help pages online";
            save and restart
        <li>To get local access, you can select Safari's Preferences,
            then the Advanced pane, then checkmark "Show Develop menu in menu bar"
            </ol>
        If you're using another browser, like Chrome or Firefox, you
        shouldn't encounter this issue.
    </li>
    <li>We will be removing a number of deprecated classes after
        JMRI 4.26 is released in December 2021. If your scripts are
        generating messages like:<br/>
        <code>WARN  - SomeClassName is deprecated, please remove references to it</code><br/>
        you should update your script to replace that class.  If you don't know how, please
        ask on the
        <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">JMRIusers list</a>.
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21.1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo class has become a jmri.SystemConnectionMemo
        interface and a jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo class. This may
        require changes to scripts.  If you have a script that references
        jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo, please change it to either
        jmri.SystemConnectionMemo or jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo
        (it's easier to have you just try the two than to explain which
        one will work in which case)
    </li>

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21.1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The way preferences are loaded at startup has been slightly
        modified.  There is no impact to JMRI applications, but Non-JMRI
        applications that are not derived from apps.Apps or apps.AppsBase
        but are using jmri.implementation.JmriConfigurationManager to load
        preferences will no longer see preferences if an error occurs.  To
        restore the old behavior, use apps.AppsConfigurationManager instead.
    </li>

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
        There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
        <ul>
            <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li>
            <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li>
            <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li>
            <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li>
            <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li>
        </ul>
        Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
        open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.
    </li>
</ul>

                </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>

          <li>The action Listen On Beans is improved.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Operations</h3>
        <a id="Operations" name="Operations"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed pick up car error on Manifests when using route blocking order.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <a id="Scripting" name="Scripting"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added
            <a href="https://jmri.org/jython/KeyListenerExample.py">KeyListenerExample</li>,
            a sample script that shows how to listen to the keyboard.
        </ul>

    <h3>Signals</h3>
        <a id="Signals" name="Signals"></a>

        <h4>Signal Systems</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed a bug in the CCOR-1967 set that kept one
                    aspect from displaying properly.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Throttle</h3>
        <a id="throttle" name="throttle"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added ControlPanel.getSpeedSlider() for scripting</li>
            <li>Added default throttle file preference, will be loaded when a new throttle is acquired and no specific roster entry exist for the used address</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Transit</h3>
        <a id="Transit" name="Transit"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Transits can now have unlimited number of sections.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Warrants</h3>
        <a id="Wt" name="Wt"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Loss of control when train loses occupation detection
             (dirty track or pickup, unreliable sensor, etc) is fixed.
             Formerly trains could run uncontrolled at their current speed
             setting. An emergency stop is made and speed is set to zero
             upon loss of detection.</li>
            <li>Calculation of ramp times and distances is improved. However,
              the need for good data of path lengths and train speed profiles
              remains.</li>
            <li>The occasional freeze of the Warrant List Table is fixed.</li>
            <li>The address column of the Warrant List table is changed to show a
             roster id instead of the DCC address.  Un-rostered addresses may still be
             entered and the warrants run with such engines. In this case, the column
             entry is the address bracketed with $ signs.</li>
            <li>Warrant activity can be "traced" on the console. An Enable/Disable
             button in Warrant Preferences activates this feature. Default is
             tracing disabled.</li>
            <li>"Slow Speed Assistance" can be given when a train is inordinately
             late in getting to the next block of the script. This done only when train
             approaching the block has a speed less than a configurable percentage
             of throttle. If the train
             has not reached the block within 10 seconds of its scheduled script time,
             its speed is increased by one "Ramp Step Throttle Increment". This is
             done at 10 second intervals until either the train reaches the block or has
             attained the configurable percentage throttle speed.
             Upon entering the block the original script speed is restored.
             <br>This feature will allow balky engines with poor low speed characteristics
             to reach their destinations without stalling. The default throttle
             percentage for triggering Slow Speed Assistance is 2.5% and
             may be changed in Warrant Preferences. Slow Speed Assistance is disabled
             by setting this trigger speed to 0%.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Simplify JmriHelp, eliminate static stub files.</li>
        </ul>
