      Release Notes for JMRI 4.25.4 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: October 12, 2021</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.25.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test releases.
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI production release at the end of 2021.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.20, please follow these instructions carefully:
<!-- Note:  At this point, we're not requiring an update to 4.22; change if needed-->
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later relese.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>New problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This test release does not work with Java version 8u311 or later.
        To use this test release, please either use an earlier version of
        Java 8, update your Java installation to Java 11,
        or install a later test release such as
        <a href="jmri4.25.5.shtml">JMRI 4.25.5</a> or any later version.
    </li>
</ul>
If any of those affect you, please either
wait for
<a href="jmri4.25.5.shtml">JMRI 4.25.5</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>

    <li>
    </li>

</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.20.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.20 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.21 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>
installing this test release.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21.1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo class has become a jmri.SystemConnectionMemo
        interface and a jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo class. This may
        require changes to scripts.  If you have a script that references
        jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo, please change it to either
        jmri.SystemConnectionMemo or jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo
        (it's easier to have you just try the two than to explain which
        one will work in which case)
    </li>

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21.1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The way preferences are loaded at startup has been slightly
        modified.  There is no impact to JMRI applications, but Non-JMRI
        applications that are not derived from apps.Apps or apps.AppsBase
        but are using jmri.implementation.JmriConfigurationManager to load
        preferences will no longer see preferences if an error occurs.  To
        restore the old behavior, use apps.AppsConfigurationManager instead.
    </li>

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
        There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
        <ul>
            <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li>
            <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li>
            <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li>
            <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li>
            <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li>
        </ul>
        Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
        open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.
    </li>
</ul>
