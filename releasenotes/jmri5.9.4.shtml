      Release Notes for JMRI 5.9.4 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: September 13, 2024</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.9.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.9.* test releases.
It requires at least Java 11 to work.
We recommend that you use Java 17.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI  production release in December 2024.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<!--
<P>We are getting close to the next production release, so we would particularly
appreciate your testing of this release to make sure it works for you. That way,
if you find new problems, we can try to fix them before the production release.</P>
 -->

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.
We would appreciate your feedback on it.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>New problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>LogixNG Timers configured to fire when JMRI starts do not work properly in this release. 
        It will be fixed in 5.9.5 and 5.10.</li>
    <li>WiThrottle Server does not work properly in this release. (crashes when sending Turnouts or Routes),
        It will be fixed in 5.9.5 and 5.10. Workaround is to disable Turnouts and Routes under Preferences, WiThrottle Server, Allowed Controls</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either
wait for
<a href="jmri5.7.7.shtml">JMRI 5.7.7</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a

<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.


    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>OpenLCB_Java lib updated to release 0.8.1, which includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Better GUI for the node selection tool, which improves
                            layout of the firmware upgrade window, send tool window,
                            memory tool window and other places.
                        <li>Event ID fields now have a contextual menu to assist in
                            specifying well-known events, time (clock) events, and
                            DCC accessory decoder events.  These are also available
                            from the "More..." buttons on the CDI window.
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Improve memory tools:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allow selection of space 0 - 255 in Memory R/W tool and Send Frame Tool,
                            with data entry in either hex or decimal
                        <li>Improve display of available spaces by omitting missing spaces to reduce length of display
                    </ul>
                <li>Send Frame tool will no longer allow you to access CDI if there's no CDI in the node.
                    This prevents you from accidentally getting into a confusing situation.
                <li>Firmware Upgrade Tool and Memory Tool now let you select the memory space
                    with a decimal or hexadecimal number.
                <li>Implements the slider and action button proposal in CDI.  There are
                    no products using this, but we'll be ready when they're introduced.
            </ul>

                had a serious bug. If the user doesn't have permission to store,

            <li>New Permission user names are now case-insensitive and stored using
                lower case. Existing Permission user names are unaffected by this
