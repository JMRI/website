<p>We are very pleased to announce that the 5.5 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production Release 5.6" available for download today.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>New problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>LogixNG Timers configured to fire when JMRI starts do not work properly in this release. 
        It will be fixed in 5.9.5 and 5.10.</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either
wait for
<a href="jmri5.7.1.shtml">JMRI 5.7.1</a>, due out shortly,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this production release:</h3>

See the <a href="jmri5.4.shtml#warnings">JMRI 5.4 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 5.5 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>
before installing this release, see above.

<ul>
    <li>This release, and all previous ones, have an incompatibility between
        MacOS 13.6 or later and the SPROG support.  The fix for this will be
        in 
        <a href="jmri5.7.1.shtml">JMRI 5.7.1</a>. 
        when it's available.
        Note that this issue only impacts the 
        combination of SPROG and certain MacOS versions.  If you're not using a Mac or 
        not using an SPROG, this will not effect you.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.7.shtml">JMRI 5.3.7</a></span>
        The definition of "Last Seen" for Id Tags has been
        clarified to mean "Location where the tag was last seen to be <u>present</u>".
        Previously, a report that a tag was <u>absent</u> could be remembered as the
        last seen report.  The relevant code changes are specific to LocoNet
        Reporters. This might affect your scripts and LogixNG if you were assuming
        the prior behavior.
        </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.7.shtml">JMRI 5.3.7</a></span>
        Some Reporters, particularly LocoNet, would improperly clear an "enter" report
        when an "exits" report for the same tag was seen elsewhere.  This was an
        error that has been fixed, but if you have scripts or LogixNG that depend on
        this behavior you might have to update them.
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.3.shtml">JMRI 5.5.3</a></span>
        <strong>LocoNet Server</strong> and <strong>LocoNet Client</strong> have been removed.
        If you are using these, you need to change the connection to
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/LbServer.shtml">LocoNet over TCP</a> instead.</li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.3.shtml">JMRI 5.5.3</a></span>
        Scripts that output Logging statements with log4jv1.x ( org.apache.log4j ) imports need to be updated to use SLF4J logging.
        <br>See <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/12237/files">here</a> for some examples on how to do this.</li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.4.shtml">JMRI 5.5.4</a></span>
        Custom default.lcf Logging Control Files no longer work with this version.
        <br>To create a custom default_lcf.xml in the new Logging Configuration format, see 
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/Debug.shtml">JMRI Debugging and Logging</a>
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.5.shtml">JMRI 5.5.5</a></span>
        The format of XML files with table contents and panels have been changed. It's therefore not
        possible to load an xml file with tables and panels that has been created with JMRI 5.5.5 or
        later into a JMRI version before JMRI 5.5.5.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.5.shtml">JMRI 5.5.5</a></span>
        MQTT Connection - Throttle loco address and function placeholders in MQTT topics have changed from
        $address and $function to {0} and {1} for consistency with other objects.

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri5.4.shtml">production release 5.4</a>:</h2>

<p>
This production version is made from test releases 5.5.1 through 5.5.8  The
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pulls?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2023-06-25..2023-12-08">full list of changes</a>
in those is
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pulls?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2023-06-25..2023-12-08">available from our code repository</a>.

    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>
	    <h4><a href="http://bidib.org/index_e.html">BiDiB</a></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Eckart Meyer has provided a first implementation
                    for the
                    <a href="http://bidib.org/index_e.html">BiDiB</a>
                    system connection.
                    </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>C/MRI</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Provided an extra copy of the output data when preparing
                    C/MRI output data for a "T" ("Transmit") message type.  This
                    prevents a "data buffer overrun" in a pre-configured buffer
                    when the output data changes when the process assemble the data.
                    (The previous implementation could run out of available bytes
                    in the buffer, and the data would not be sent.)</li>
                <li>Fix the Update button on the sensor table 
                    for C/MRI sensors.</li>
            </ul>


        <h4>DCC++ and DCC-EX</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Call "Roster Export to DCC-EX" from DCC++ menu</li>
                <li>Traffic Monitor - Added option to suppress the parsed text</li>
                <li>New Virtual LCD window</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Shutdown LocoNetOverTcp connection cleanly when program ends</li>
                <li><strong>LocoNet Server</strong> and <strong>LocoNet Client</strong> have been removed.
                    If you are using these, you need to change the connection to
                    <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/LbServer.shtml">LocoNet over TCP</a> instead.
                <li>Added a DecoderPro definition for the DS78V. This required
                    code changes, so this definition will not work with earlier
                    versions of JMRI.</li>
                <li>The jython/loconet/LnEditEvolutionRoutesAndOpSw.py script has been updated
                    to version 2.0.
                    This script allows you to configure the OpSw and routes in the new Digitrax
                    Series 7 boards.
                </li>
                <li>The jython/loconet/PGM_DS74_GEN.py can be used to program DS74 boards
                    from a configuration held in a text file.</li>
                <li>Fix NPE, and decode Extended Accessory Signal Aspect IMM commands</li>
                <li>Fix LnSendTool.py to correctly send signal aspects up to 255 NMRA 2.4.3</li>
                <li>Added LocoNet Monitor support for PM74.</li>
                <li>Improved the internal queuing mechanism for transmitted messages.
                    This will prevent messages being delayed occasionally.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>MQTT</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve threading on MQTT Reporters to reduce latency.</li>
                <li>Added support for Track Power control</li>
                <li>Added support for throttle control  - speed, direction, and functions</li>
                <li>Added support for Command Station consists</li>
                <li>Fixed bug that stopped retained MQTT messages from being received on start up.</li>
                <li>Clear Last Will and Testament on startup</li>

                <li>Fixed issue with MQTT LWT messages</li>
                <li>Changed throttle loco address placeholder in MQTT topics to {0} for consistency with other objects</li>
                <li>Changed throttle function placeholder in MQTT topics to {1} for consistency with other objects</li>
                <li>Fixed an issue in introduced in 5.5.5 where the incorrect default topics were used for Direction and Function.  The documenation was correct but the code wasn't.</li>
                <li>JMRI will now use the railroad name from the preferences
                    when creating the client ID.  This will make it easier to
                    identify the JMRI connection in the MQTT broker logs.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>

                <li>OpenLCB library updated through
                    <a href="https://github.com/openlcb/OpenLCB_Java/pulls">PR 231</a>.
                    </li>
                <li>Added a contextual menu (right click, ctrl click) to tabs in the CDI display that
                    contains "Copy" and "Paste" options.
                    Copy and paste works both within one window and across windows.
                    You can only paste into a tab of the same type from which you copied.
                    The data stored in the clipboard is in the format of the usual backup files.

                    to the Send Message tool. </li>
                <li>Fixed a bug that could cause an exception when closing a configuration window.</li>
                <li>Better aligned the Event IDs displayed in the monitor window.</li>
                <li>Updates to most recent OpenLCB Java library, which includes
                    <ul>

    <h3>Layout Editor</h3>
        <a id="LE" name="LE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>A number of issues with the Shape tool have been resolved including Java
                exceptions and the possibility of truncated shape lines.</li>
            <li>The Layout Editor help page has been updated with details for using Shapes.</li>
            <li>Previously, Reporter icons would display
                "&lt;no report&gt;" when the report information was null, i.e. there was no 
                information available from the Reporter.  This has been changed
                to a hyphen ("-") when there's no information available to reduce screen
                clutter on complex panels.
	        <li>Labels and icons on a panel can now have one or more classes. This is useful if the label/icon is controlled by LogixNG.</li>
	        <li>Add option(s) for restoring block values, issue #12459</li>
	        <li>The LogixNG Icon has been added to the toolbars.  The LogixNG Icon can run inline

                <li>Check for LogixNG references before deleting an Entry/Exit pair.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Note:</strong> If tables and panels are stored with this JMRI version, the file
          might not load in a previous version of JMRI if it includes LogixNG. This is because JMRI
          now stores some LogixNG data in a different way than before.</li>
          <br>
          <li>New actions
            <ul>
              <li>The <strong>Icon/Label by class on panel</strong> action is added.
                  It allows LogixNG to control all icons/labels of a class.</li>
              <li>The action <strong>Throttle function</strong> has been added. It's similar to the action
                  <strong>Throttle</strong>, except that it only sets a function, not speed or direction, and
                  that it doesn't have any child actions.</li>
              <li>The action <strong>Audio icon on web panel</strong> is added to the category
                  <strong>Display</strong>. This action can tell an <strong>Audio</strong> icon on
                  a Panel editor to play the sound when the panel is shown in a web browser, for
                  example on a tablet or mobile phone.</li>
              <li>The action <strong>Timer</strong> has been improved. It can now be used within a
                  LogixNG module. It also supports local variables to tell the different delays for the
                  timers in the Timer action.<br>
                  To use the Timer action in a LogixNG module, have an <strong>Always true</strong>
                  expression as <strong>Start</strong> expression for the Timer action, together with the
                  option <strong>Start/Stop by Start expression</strong> selected.</strong></li>
              <li>The action <strong>Block</strong> and the expressions <strong>Block</strong>,
                  <strong>Dispatcher</strong> and <strong>Sensor</strong> has been refactored.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Improved actions
            <ul>
              <li>The action <strong>Sequence</strong> is now safe to use in LogixNG modules. The action
                  had a bug which made it sometimes fail if it was used in a module and that module was called
                  from several ConditionalNGs at once.</li>
              <li>A bug in the LogixNG action <strong>Logix</strong> has been fixed. The Logix
                  feature <strong>When triggered</strong> didn't work with the LogixNG action
                  <strong>Logix</strong> but has now been resolved.</li>
              <li>The action <strong>On Change</strong> has been renamed to <strong>Logix Action</strong>.
              <li>The <strong>Entry/Exit</strong> action can activate and deactivate Entry/Exit routes,
                  including activating a reversed route if the Entry/Exit pair has the <strong>Both Way</strong>
                  option enabled.</li>
              <li>The action <strong>Audio</strong>
                  no longer let the user select an Audio buffer when edition the action.
                  LogixNG can only act on Audio sources and the Audio listener so there
                  is no point in selecting an audio buffer for LogixNG.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>New expressions
            <ul>
              <li>The expression <strong>File as flag</strong> has been added. It returns true if
                  a particular file exists.</li>
              <li>The <strong>Audio</strong> expression has been added. It lets
                  LogixNG listen on an Audio and take appropriate action.</li>
              <li>The expression <strong>Timer</strong> has been added. It returns <strong>False</strong>
                  until some time has passed. It then returns <strong>True</strong> once and the timer starts
                  again. This expression is intended to be used together with the action <strong>Sequence</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Improved expressions
            <ul>
              <li>Warrant expression was not listening for warrant events.  Fixed along with the long
                  description.</li>
              <li>The expression <strong>Entry/exit</strong> can now check if a
                  entry/exit is reversed or bidirectional.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Other improvements
            <ul>
              <li>A new <strong>LogixNG</strong> icon has been added to Panel Editor.
                  When the icon is clicked, it will execute the inline LogixNG of that icon.
                  If the inline LogixNG has several ConditionalNGs, the ConditionalNGs will
                  be executed in the order they got created.</li>
              <li>A new option is added to the <strong>ConditionalNG</strong> table when
                  editing a LogixNG. By default, all the ConditionalNGs are executed when the
                  panel is loaded if the LogixNG is enabled. But if the <strong>Startup</strong>
                  checkbox is unchecked, the ConditionalNG will not be executed when the panel
                  is loaded. This is in particular useful for the <strong>LogixNG</strong> icon
                  that's added in this JMRI version.</li>
              <li>A new tool <strong>Where Used</strong> has been added to LogixNG.
                  It shows where in the LogixNG tree an item is used. The tool is found
                  on menu item <strong>Tools &rArr; LogixNG &rArr; Where Used</strong>.</li>
              <li>Add the <strong>GET_BLOCK_WARRANT</strong> and <strong>GET_BLOCK_TRAIN_NAME</strong>
                  OBlock actions to the OBlock Logix import.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Operations</h3>
        <a id="Operations" name="Operations"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>Improvements to the routing code. Program will not use an interchange track if the same
            train can drop and pull a car.</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug with export routes.</li>
          <li>Fixed close on Save for several windows.</li>
          <li>New tools "Preview and Print Car routing report" in the "Set Car" window that provides
            the train routing for a car that has a final destination.</li>
          <li>New tool "Show Staging and Schedules by Car Type and Load" in the "Schedules" window that
            shows which car types and loads are shipped from staging.</li>
          <li>New feature for spurs, the ability to prevent a car's load change. Useful when the
            spur/schedule is used for a RIP track.</li>
          <li>New feature for staging, planned pickups.</li>
            <li>Improvements to the car, locomotive, and train preview and print tools.</li>

            <li>Script to update Car/Locomotive Tables on update to Id Tag Table User Name</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="PE" name="PE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Labels and icons on a panel can now have one or more classes. This is useful if the label/icon is controlled by LogixNG.</li>
            <li>A new <strong>LogixNG</strong> icon has been added to Panel Editor. When the icon is
            clicked, it will execute the inline LogixNG of that icon. If the inline LogixNG has several
            ConditionalNGs, the ConditionalNGs will be executed in the order they got created.</li>
            <li>It's now possible to select an icon below another icon. Right-click on
            the icon to open the popup menu of the icon. If there are any icons at the
            mouse position below this icon, the sub menu <strong>Icons below</strong>
            will appear at the end of the popup menu. The sub menu will contain all
            the icons below this icon. These menu items will open the popup menu for
            for its icon.</li>
            <li>A new <strong>Audio</strong> icon has been added to Panel Editor.
            It can be used to play audio on a web panel, or let the user start
            playing sound in JMRI by clicking on the Audio icon. When editing the
            panel, the popup menu for the icon has a new sub menu <strong>Web
            panels</strong> that sets the options for how the icon should act on
            a web panel.<br>
            If the icon is used to play sound on a web panel, the option
            <strong>Hide when not editing</strong> might be useful if the user
            shouldn't see the icon. The icon plays the sound even if it's not
            visible.<br>
            The LogixNG action <strong>Audio icon on web panel</strong> can be
            used to tell the <strong>Audio</strong> icon to play the sound when
            it is displayed on a web browser, for example on a tablet or mobile
            phone.</li>
        </ul>


    <h3>Control Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="CPE" name="CPE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Labels and icons on a panel can now have one or more classes. This is useful if the label/icon is controlled by LogixNG.</li>

        <a id="Preferences" name="Preferences"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Custom default.lcf Logging Control Files will cease to take effect.
            <br>To create a custom default_lcf.xml in the new Logging Configuration format, see 
            <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/Debug.shtml">JMRI Debugging and Logging</a>
            </li>
            <li>The <strong>Shutdown</strong> preference has two options for ignoring special kinds
            of changes.  The first is to ignore fast clock changes, the second ignores the text and
            background color changes for sensors that have been changed to panel labels.</li>
            <li>The startup action <strong>Open file</strong> has been renamed to
            <strong>Load table content and panels</strong>.</li>
            <li>Each startup action now has an <strong>Enabled</strong> checkbox
            so that each startup action can be enabled/disabled.</li>
        </ul>

                how to run a system command from a JMRI script.</li>
            <li>Scripts that output Logging statements with log4j should be updated to import sl4fj logging.
            <br><a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/12237/files">See here for some examples</a> on how to do this.</li>
            <li>Scripts that output Logging statements with log4jv1.x ( org.apache.log4j ) imports will stop working 
            and should be updated to use SLF4J logging.
            <br>See <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/12237/files">here</a> for some examples on how to do this.</li>
            <li>TurnoutStatePersistence.py was not correctly updated to use SLF4J in 5.5.3, fixed in 5.5.4</li>

        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>IdTags now request the main IdTagManager instead of requesting a 
                ProxyIdManager to get better initialization.</li>
            <li>Added JMRI version number to the bottom of generated Javadoc.</li>
            <li>Updated the Java Native Access (JNA) library to version 5.13.0.
                Updated the Pure Java Comm library to a custom version that should
                work better on Apple Silicon (M1, M2) Macs.</li>
            <li>A signal handler has been added to the Shutdown manager such that a 
                "kill &lt;pid&gt;" command on Mac or Linux will do a normal shutdown.
                This is particularly useful for e.g. running headless on an RPi.
                "kill -HUP &lt;pid&gt;" will cause JMRI to quit and restart.
                In addition, the Mac and Linux startup scripts were updated to 
                pass these signals on to the running process.  Together, this
                will allow you to run JMRI as a service on Mac and Linux, including the RPi.
          <li>The external libraries used for Logging have been updated.</li>
          <li>The <strong>Hide when empty and not editing</strong> menu item has been added to
                the right click pop-up menus for block content labels, memory labels and LogixNG global
                variable labels.  This applies to Panel Editor, Control Panel Editor and Layout Editor
                panels.</li>
          <li>Added a jython/test/loconet directory for LocoNet-specific scripting tests,
              along with an initial test.</li>
            <li>Logging Configuration Files have moved to the xml format, eg.
            <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/default_lcf.xml">default_lcf.xml</a>
            <br><strong>Custom default.lcf Logging Control Files will cease to take effect.</strong>
            <br>To create a custom default_lcf.xml in the new format, see 
            <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/Debug.shtml">JMRI Debugging and Logging</a>
            </li>
            <li>Logging levels ( eg. INFO, DEBUG ) can be changed for the current session in
            <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/jmrit/log/Log4JTreePane.shtml">Display / Edit Log Categories</a></li>
            <li>Logging Libraries have been fully updated to Log4J 2.20</li>
            <li>The Rolling Log files have been renamd from messages.log.1 and messages.log.2 to messages.1.log and messages.2.log</li>
            <li>The way data is entered in memory icons, block icons
                and global variable icons have been improved.</li>
            <li>You can now set the preferences to open the RailCom table at startup.</li>
            <li>The analog fast clock now shows when the fast clock has been stopped.</li>
            <li>Updated batik-transcoder 1.14 to 1.17, resolving a security issue</li>
            <li>Improvements to Dialog boxes when displayed with &quot;Always On Top&quot; window frames present.</li>
            <li>Improved Unrecoverable Error Dialog.</li>
            <li>JMRI now has a "Software Bill of Materials" (SBOM) distributed with it.
                Although this won't matter to most users, it allows people to determine
                via the standardized SPDX mechanism the libraries that JMRI contains and
                the versions being used. Providing this is a small step toward more automated
                distribution.</li>
            <li>UI improvements for the
                <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/jmrit/log/Log4JTreePane.shtml">
                Display / Edit Log Categories</a> dialog.</li>
            <li>(For developers) Our CI process has been updated to require the
                @Override annotation on overriding methods and removal of unused import statements.</li>
            <li>Fixed a validation errors in the xml/schema/auxiliary-configuration.xsd  file.</li>
            <li>Fixed a problem where the run/pause button would not properly show when the
                Nixie, LCD or Pragotron clocks were resized.</li>
            <li>Fixed a problem that prevented JMRI from launching on macOS if Java 21 was in use.
                (Java 11 is still the recommended one)
            <li>Improved the
                "<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/FileUpdate.shtml">Updating Decoder Definitions</a>"
                page.</li>
