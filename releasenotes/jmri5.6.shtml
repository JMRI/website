<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<h3>New warnings for this production release:</h3>

See the <a href="jmri5.2.shtml#warnings">JMRI 5.2 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 5.3 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>
before installing this release.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/JVMCapabilities.shtml">JVM Capabilities</a> pages.
    </li>
    <li>This release, and all previous ones, have an incompatibility between
        MacOS 13.6 or later and the SPROG support.  The fix for this will be
        in 
        <a href="jmri5.7.1.shtml">JMRI 5.7.1</a>. 
        when it's available.
        Note that this issue only impacts the 
        combination of SPROG and certain MacOS versions.  If you're not using a Mac or 
        not using an SPROG, this will not effect you.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.2.shtml">JMRI 5.3.2</a></span>
        Some images in the <i>resources/icons</i> folder have been renamed.
        Spaces have been changed to underscore. It's images in the
        <i>resources/icons/ItalianSignals/ACEI</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/ItalianSignals/Prototypical</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/smallschematics/aspects/NW-1981</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/smallschematics/aspects/NYC-1956</i>,
        <i>xml/signals/FS-1987</i>, <i>xml/signals/NW-1981</i>,
        <i>xml/signals/NYC-1956</i> and <i>resources/icons/SNCF/Small</i>
        folders that have been renamed. If you are using these images directly, you will need to update the reference.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.1.7.shtml">JMRI 5.1.7</a></span>
        The way defaults for some LocoNet connections are handled has changed.
        Existing LocoNet connections might give a "The Defaults preferences are invalid"
        warning when saving preferences.  In that case, click "yes" and then go set
        all the default radio buttons on the "Defaults" pane to the LocoNet connection.  (You can also
        click "no", but you'll get the message next time you store too)
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.3.shtml">JMRI 5.3.3</a></span>
        The code for Loconet programming operations was significantly changed.
        If you encounter any (new) troubles programming via Loconet, please get in touch on the
        <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">JMRIusers list</a>.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.7.shtml">JMRI 5.3.7</a></span>
        The definition of "Last Seen" for Id Tags has been
        clarified to mean "Location where the tag was last seen to be <u>present</u>".
        Previously, a report that a tag was <u>absent</u> could be remembered as the
        last seen report.  The relevant code changes are specific to LocoNet
        Reporters. This might affect your scripts and LogixNG if you were assuming
        the prior behavior.
        </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.7.shtml">JMRI 5.3.7</a></span>
        Some Reporters, particularly LocoNet, would improperly clear an "enter" report
        when an "exits" report for the same tag was seen elsewhere.  This was an
        error that has been fixed, but if you have scripts or LogixNG that depend on
        this behavior you might have to update them.

<p>
This production version is made from test releases 5.5.1 through 5.5.8  The
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pulls?utf8=✓&q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2023-06-25..2023-12-08">full list of changes</a>
in those is
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pulls?utf8=✓&q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2023-06-25..2023-12-08">available from our code repository</a>.


<!-- From 5.5.1 ===================================================================================== -->

    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>
	    <h4><a href="http://bidib.org/index_e.html">BiDiB</a></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Eckart Meyer has provided a first implementation
                    for the
                    <a href="http://bidib.org/index_e.html">BiDiB</a>
                    system connection.
                    </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>C/MRI</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Provided an extra copy of the output data when preparing
                    C/MRI output data for a "T" ("Transmit") message type.  This
                    prevents a "data buffer overrun" in a pre-configured buffer
                    when the output data changes when the process assemble the data.
                    (The previous implementation could run out of available bytes
                    in the buffer, and the data would not be sent.)</li>
                <li>Fix the Update button on the sensor table 
                    for C/MRI sensors.</li>
            </ul>


        <h4>DCC++ and DCC-EX</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Call "Roster Export to DCC-EX" from DCC++ menu</li>
                <li>Traffic Monitor - Added option to suppress the parsed text</li>
                <li>New Virtual LCD window</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Shutdown LocoNetOverTcp connection cleanly when program ends</li>
                <li><strong>LocoNet Server</strong> and <strong>LocoNet Client</strong> have been removed.
                    If you are using these, you need to change the connection to
                    <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/LbServer.shtml">LocoNet over TCP</a> instead.
                <li>Added a DecoderPro definition for the DS78V. This required
                    code changes, so this definition will not work with earlier
                    versions of JMRI.</li>
                <li>The jython/loconet/LnEditEvolutionRoutesAndOpSw.py script has been updated
                    to version 2.0.
                    This script allows you to configure the OpSw and routes in the new Digitrax
                    Series 7 boards.
                </li>
                <li>The jython/loconet/PGM_DS74_GEN.py can be used to program DS74 boards
                    from a configuration held in a text file.</li>
                <li>Fix NPE, and decode Extended Accessory Signal Aspect IMM commands</li>
                <li>Fix LnSendTool.py to correctly send signal aspects up to 255 NMRA 2.4.3</li>
                <li>Added LocoNet Monitor support for PM74.</li>
                <li>Improved the internal queuing mechanism for transmitted messages.
                    This will prevent messages being delayed occasionally.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>MQTT</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve threading on MQTT Reporters to reduce latency.</li>
                <li>Added support for Track Power control</li>
                <li>Added support for throttle control  - speed, direction, and functions</li>
                <li>Added support for Command Station consists</li>
                <li>Fixed bug that stopped retained MQTT messages from being received on start up.</li>
                <li>Clear Last Will and Testament on startup</li>
                <li>Fixed issue with invalid throttle speed message causing MQTT to disconnect</li>
                <li>Improved robustness of MQTT Event Listener exception handling</li>
                <li>Fixed issue with MQTT LWT messages</li>
                <li>Changed throttle loco address placeholder in MQTT topics to {0} for consistency with other objects</li>
                <li>Changed throttle function placeholder in MQTT topics to {1} for consistency with other objects</li>
                <li>Fixed an issue in introduced in 5.5.5 where the incorrect default topics were used for Direction and Function.  The documenation was correct but the code wasn't.</li>
                <li>JMRI will now use the railroad name from the preferences
                    when creating the client ID.  This will make it easier to
                    identify the JMRI connection in the MQTT broker logs.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Add upload and download of the CS-105 consisting information
                    to and from the DecoderPro roster entry's consisting bits.</li>

                <li>OpenLCB library updated through
                    <a href="https://github.com/openlcb/OpenLCB_Java/pulls">PR 231</a>.
                    </li>
                <li>Added a contextual menu (right click, ctrl click) to tabs in the CDI display that
                    contains "Copy" and "Paste" options.
                    Copy and paste works both within one window and across windows.
                    You can only paste into a tab of the same type from which you copied.
                    The data stored in the clipboard is in the format of the usual backup files.

    <h3>Layout Editor</h3>
        <a id="LE" name="LE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>A number of issues with the Shape tool have been resolved including Java
                exceptions and the possibility of truncated shape lines.</li>
            <li>The Layout Editor help page has been updated with details for using Shapes.</li>
            <li>Previously, Reporter icons would display
                "&lt;no report&gt;" when the report information was null, i.e. there was no 
                information available from the Reporter.  This has been changed
                to a hyphen ("-") when there's no information available to reduce screen
                clutter on complex panels.
	        <li>Labels and icons on a panel can now have one or more classes. This is useful if the label/icon is controlled by LogixNG.</li>
	        <li>add option(s) for restoring block values, issue #12459</li>
	        <li>The LogixNG Icon has been added to the toolbars.  The LogixNG Icon can run inline
	            LogixNGs by clicking on the icon or text label when converted to text.</li>
	        <li>The Audio Icon has been added to the toolbars.  The Audio Icon can play a sound
                on a web panel, for example a Tablet.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>NX - Entry/Exit Tool</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fix Both Way route selection.</li>
                <li>Validate the sensor selections for the <strong>Add Pair</strong> action.</li>
                <li>Check for LogixNG references before deleting an Entry/Exit pair.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>The expression <strong>File as flag</strong> has been added. It returns true if
              a particular file exists.</li>
          <li>The <strong>Icon/Label by class on panel</strong> action is added.
              It allows LogixNG to control all icons/labels of a class.</li>
          <li>The <strong>Audio</strong> expression has been added. It lets
              LogixNG listen on an Audio and take appropriate action.</li>
          <li>A new <strong>LogixNG</strong> icon has been added to Panel Editor.
          When the icon is clicked, it will execute the inline LogixNG of that icon.
          If the inline LogixNG has several ConditionalNGs, the ConditionalNGs will
          be executed in the order they got created.</li>
          <li>A new option is added to the <strong>ConditionalNG</strong> table when
          editing a LogixNG. By default, all the ConditionalNGs are executed when the
          panel is loaded if the LogixNG is enabled. But if the <strong>Startup</strong>
          checkbox is unchecked, the ConditionalNG will not be executed when the panel
          is loaded. This is in particular useful for the <strong>LogixNG</strong> icon
          that's added in this JMRI version.</li>
          <li>A new tool <strong>Where Used</strong> has been added to LogixNG.
          It shows where in the LogixNG tree an item is used. The tool is found
          on menu item <strong>Tools &rArr; LogixNG &rArr; Where Used</strong>.</li>
          <li>A bug in the LogixNG action <strong>Logix</strong> has been fixed. The Logix
          feature <strong>When triggered</strong> didn't work with the LogixNG action
          <strong>Logix</strong> but has now been resolved.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>On Change</strong> has been renamed to <strong>Logix Action</strong>.
          <li>The action <strong>Audio</strong> and the expression <strong>Audio</strong>
          no longer let the user select an Audio buffer when edition the action/expression.
          LogixNG can only act on or listen to Audio sources and the Audio listener so there
          is no point in selecting an audio buffer for LogixNG.</li>
          <li><strong>Note:</strong> If tables and panels are stored with this JMRI version, the file
          might not load in a previous version of JMRI if it includes LogixNG. This is because JMRI
          now stores some LogixNG data in a different way than before.</li>

          <li>The expression <strong>Timer</strong> has been added. It returns <strong>False</strong>
          until some time has passed. It then returns <strong>True</strong> once and the timer starts
          again. This expression is intended to be used together with the action <strong>Sequence</strong>.</li>

          <li>The action <strong>Throttle function</strong> has been added. It's similar to the action
          <strong>Throttle</strong>, except that it only sets a function, not speed or direction, and
          that it doesn't have any child actions.</li>

          <li>The action <strong>Sequence</strong> is now safe to use in LogixNG modules. The action
          had a bug which made it sometimes fail if it was used in a module and that module was called
          from several ConditionalNGs at once.</li>

          <li>When a LogixNG was created and ConditionalNGs
          was created for that LogixNG, the ConditionalNGs
          wasn't executing until restart of JMRI if the
          ConditionalNGs had the <strong>Startup</strong>
          flag unchecked. That's fixed now.</li>

          <li>Warrant expression was not listening for warrant events.  Fixed along with the long
          description.</li>

          <li>Add the <strong>GET_BLOCK_WARRANT</strong> and <strong>GET_BLOCK_TRAIN_NAME</strong>
          OBlock actions to the OBlock Logix import.</li>

          <li>The action <strong>Timer</strong> has been improved. It can now be used within a
          LogixNG module. It also supports local variables to tell the different delays for the
          timers in the Timer action.<br>
          To use the Timer action in a LogixNG module, have an <strong>Always true</strong>
          expression as <strong>Start</strong> expression for the Timer action, together with the
          option <strong>Start/Stop by Start expression</strong> selected.</strong></li>

          <li>The action <strong>Audio icon on web panel</strong> is added to the category
          <strong>Display</strong>. This action can tell an <strong>Audio</strong> icon on
          a Panel editor to play the sound when the panel is shown in a web browser, for
          example on a tablet or mobile phone.</li>

          <li>The action <strong>Block</strong> and the expressions <strong>Block</strong>,
          <strong>Dispatcher</strong> and <strong>Sensor</strong> has been refactored.</li>

          <li>The expression <strong>Entry/exit</strong> can now check if a
          entry/exit is reversed or bidirectional.</li>
          <li>The <strong>Entry/Exit</strong> action can activate and deactivate Entry/Exit routes,
          including activating a reversed route if the Entry/Exit pair has the <strong>Both Way</strong>
          option enabled.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="PE" name="PE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Labels and icons on a panel can now have one or more classes. This is useful if the label/icon is controlled by LogixNG.</li>
            <li>A new <strong>LogixNG</strong> icon has been added to Panel Editor. When the icon is
            clicked, it will execute the inline LogixNG of that icon. If the inline LogixNG has several
            ConditionalNGs, the ConditionalNGs will be executed in the order they got created.</li>
            <li>It's now possible to select an icon below another icon. Right-click on
            the icon to open the popup menu of the icon. If there are any icons at the
            mouse position below this icon, the sub menu <strong>Icons below</strong>
            will appear at the end of the popup menu. The sub menu will contain all
            the icons below this icon. These menu items will open the popup menu for
            for its icon.</li>
            <li>A new <strong>Audio</strong> icon has been added to Panel Editor.
            It can be used to play audio on a web panel, or let the user start
            playing sound in JMRI by clicking on the Audio icon. When editing the
            panel, the popup menu for the icon has a new sub menu <strong>Web
            panels</strong> that sets the options for how the icon should act on
            a web panel.<br>
            If the icon is used to play sound on a web panel, the option
            <strong>Hide when not editing</strong> might be useful if the user
            shouldn't see the icon. The icon plays the sound even if it's not
            visible.<br>
            The LogixNG action <strong>Audio icon on web panel</strong> can be
            used to tell the <strong>Audio</strong> icon to play the sound when
            it is displayed on a web browser, for example on a tablet or mobile
            phone.</li>
        </ul>

            <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/Debug.shtml">JMRI Debugging and Logging</a>
            </li>
            <li>The <strong>Shutdown</strong> preference has two options for ignoring special kinds
            of changes.  The first is to ignore fast clock changes, the second ignores the text and
            background color changes for sensors that have been changed to panel labels.</li>
            <li>The startup action <strong>Open file</strong> has been renamed to
            <strong>Load table content and panels</strong>.</li>
            <li>Each startup action now has an <strong>Enabled</strong> checkbox
            so that each startup action can be enabled/disabled.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Fixed problems that were causing Learn Warrant to fail</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Web Server</h3>
        <a id="server" name="server"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>json car, engine: remove location, set unknown flag, remove from train</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Web Access</h3>
        <a id="WA" name="WA"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>panel.js - add data-panel-name attribute to support panel-specific css</li>
           <li>Web tables: add click toggle for several additional columns</li>
            <li>JSON Server: support for updating SignalHead and SignalMast Lit and Held</li>
            <li>JMRI Web Frame Server can now access many of the Dialog popup boxes.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Other Tools</h3>
        <a id="Tools" name="Tools"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The Power Control now defaults to display all connections.</li>
            <li>Handle ServerSideIncludes for /help folder #12638, makes Help from the local web server match the online version</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>IdTags now request the main IdTagManager instead of requesting a 
                ProxyIdManager to get better initialization.</li>
            <li>Added JMRI version number to the bottom of generated Javadoc.</li>
            <li>Updated the Java Native Access (JNA) library to version 5.13.0.
                Updated the Pure Java Comm library to a custom version that should
                work better on Apple Silicon (M1, M2) Macs.</li>
            <li>A signal handler has been added to the Shutdown manager such that a 
                "kill &lt;pid&gt;" command on Mac or Linux will do a normal shutdown.
                This is particularly useful for e.g. running headless on an RPi.
                "kill -HUP &lt;pid&gt;" will cause JMRI to quit and restart.
                In addition, the Mac and Linux startup scripts were updated to 
                pass these signals on to the running process.  Together, this
                will allow you to run JMRI as a service on Mac and Linux, including the RPi.
          <li>The external libraries used for Logging have been updated.</li>
          <li>The <strong>Hide when empty and not editing</strong> menu item has been added to
                the right click pop-up menus for block content labels, memory labels and LogixNG global
                variable labels.  This applies to Panel Editor, Control Panel Editor and Layout Editor
                panels.</li>
          <li>Added a jython/test/loconet directory for LocoNet-specific scripting tests,
              along with an initial test.</li>
            <li>Logging Configuration Files have moved to the xml format, eg.
            <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/default_lcf.xml">default_lcf.xml</a>
            <br><strong>Custom default.lcf Logging Control Files will cease to take effect.</strong>
            <br>To create a custom default_lcf.xml in the new format, see 
            <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/Debug.shtml">JMRI Debugging and Logging</a>
            </li>
            <li>Logging levels ( eg. INFO, DEBUG ) can be changed for the current session in
            <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/jmrit/log/Log4JTreePane.shtml">Display / Edit Log Categories</a></li>
            <li>Logging Libraries have been fully updated to Log4J 2.20</li>
            <li>The Rolling Log files have been renamd from messages.log.1 and messages.log.2 to messages.1.log and messages.2.log</li>
            <li>The way data is entered in memory icons, block icons
                and global variable icons have been improved.</li>
            <li>You can now set the preferences to open the RailCom table at startup.</li>
            <li>The analog fast clock now shows when the fast clock has been stopped.</li>
            <li>Updated batik-transcoder 1.14 to 1.17, resolving a security issue</li>
            <li>Improvements to Dialog boxes when displayed with &quot;Always On Top&quot; window frames present.</li>
            <li>Improved Unrecoverable Error Dialog.</li>
            <li>JMRI now has a "Software Bill of Materials" (SBOM) distributed with it.
                Although this won't matter to most users, it allows people to determine
                via the standardized SPDX mechanism the libraries that JMRI contains and
                the versions being used. Providing this is a small step toward more automated
                distribution.</li>
            <li>UI improvements for the
                <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/jmrit/log/Log4JTreePane.shtml">
                Display / Edit Log Categories</a> dialog.</li>
            <li>(For developers) Our CI process has been updated to require the
                @Override annotation on overriding methods and removal of unused import statements.</li>
            <li>Fixed a validation errors in the xml/schema/auxiliary-configuration.xsd  file.</li>
            <li>Fixed a problem where the run/pause button would not properly show when the
                Nixie, LCD or Pragotron clocks were resized.</li>
            <li>Fixed a problem that prevented JMRI from launching on macOS if Java 21 was in use.
                (Java 11 is still the recommended one)
            <li>Improved the
                "<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/FileUpdate.shtml">Updating Decoder Definitions</a>"
                page.</li>
