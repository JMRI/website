      Release Notes for JMRI 5.11.2 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: January 10, 2025</p>
    <p>From: release pumpkin</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.11.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.11.* test releases.
It requires at least Java 11 to work.
We recommend that you use Java 17.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI  production release in June 2025.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<!-- 
<P>We are getting close to the next production release, so we would particularly
appreciate your testing of this release to make sure it works for you. That way,
if you find new problems, we can try to fix them before the production release.</P>
 -->

<!-- 
<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.
We would appreciate your feedback on it.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  
        We recommend that you use Java 17.
        Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and

<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.


    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>

        <h4><a href="http://bidib.org/index_e.html">BiDiB</a></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Added netBiDiB as another BiDiB connection type.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed a bug in the LccPro search function on large LCC networks.</li>
                <li>Added "Node Groups" to LccPro and the Event Table.</li>
                <li>You can now create an LCC/OpenLCB
                    <a href="help/en/html/hardware/openlcb/index.shtml#stringios">StringIO</li>
                    that's shared across multiple JMRI instances on the same LCC/OpenLCB network.
                    If you change the StringIO value in one JMRI instance, it will be propagated to the 
                    other ones over the network. You can then use LogixNG or scripts to 
                    use that information to communicate between JMRI instances.
            </ul>

    <h3>DecoderPro</h3>
        <a id="DecoderPro" name="DecoderPro"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Hornby TXS Sound Decoders use CVs 200 and 201 to identify the specific Sound Profiles Uploaded to the Chip. 
                Previously the product-id verification process used CV47, 48 and 49 for these decoders. 
                Those CVs contain firmware update information which is not useful when creating conditional decoder definitions for TXS chips. 
                The product-id verification process has been modified to interrogate CVs 201 and 200 for Hornby TXS decoders.
                (This should have no effect on identification for Hornby TTS decoders.)
             </li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Dispatcher</h3>
        <a id="Dispatcher" name="Dispatcher"></a>
        <ul>
             <li>Add the ability to use an AdHoc transit, which is created dynamically between 2 blocks
             Dynamic Transits are always run "No Signals". Dynamic Transits are  removed at train termination. If
             they are not removed for any reason they will not be saved. Currently the route must be clear from end to end
             and any flaws in the routing table will cause grief. Avoid having the train stop in them.</li>
             <li>Add Ghost type block. It must have a "not real" sensor, internal is best.
             The sensor should not be manipulated by logix or logixNG or scripts. Auto trains will
             set and clear these sensors automatically, manual run trains simply ignore them.
             They are useful for adding blocks between 2 turnouts where you would normally add a tiny block with the same block
             as one of the turnouts which causes errors in the routing tables. With care they can be used for placing turnouts
             in their own block.</li>
             <li>Fix errors in loading maxlength and Maxspeed</li>
             <li>Clean up AdHoc Transits after use.</li>
             <li>Fix minor bugs in min speed settings.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>LccPro</h3>
        <a id="LccPro" name="LccPro"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug in the LccPro search function on large LCC networks.</li>
            <li>Added "Node Groups" to LccPro and the Event Table.  
            <li>Fixed a bug in Event Table display if using large fonts.<li>
        </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>The expression <strong>StringIO as string value</strong>
              has been added.</li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>

    <h3>OperationsPro</h3>
        <a id="Operations" name="Operations"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added train departure times to Yardmaster and Conductor.</li>
            <li>Fixed internationalization for Web Manifest, UK and other languages.</li>
            <li>Added the option of building train when selecting Conductor and train not built.</li>
            <li>New print option, Manifests and switch lists can now be printed double sided.</li>
            <li>Export Schedules now includes spur name and mode</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Turnouts, Lights, Sensors and other elements</h3>
        <a id="TLae" name="TLae"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/tools/StringIO.shtml">StringIOs</li>
                are a new type of object within JMRI.  They're a way to exchange informational strings
                with the layout hardware.  Over time, we'll build-out more system connections for these.
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug in the XSLT transforms used to make 
                panel files human-readable: "if" was used when "when" was required.</li>
        </ul>
