      Release Notes for JMRI 5.7.9 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: June 17, 2024</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.7.9 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.7.* test releases.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.8 production release in June 2024.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<P>We are getting close to the next production release, so we would particularly
appreciate your testing of this release to make sure it works for you. That way,
if you find new problems, we can try to fix them before the production release.</P>

<!-- 
<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.
We would appreciate your feedback on it.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?

        If you are using a RR-CirKits LocoNet to LCC gateway
        with this release, please upgrade its firmware
        to version B8g or later.  B8f or earlier will

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/JVMCapabilities.shtml">JVM Capabilities</a> pages.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.3.shtml">JMRI 5.5.3</a></span>
        Scripts that output Logging statements with log4jv1.x ( org.apache.log4j ) imports will stop working 
        from JMRI 5.5.4 and should be updated to use SLF4J logging.
        <br>See <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/12237/files">here</a> for some examples on how to do this.</li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.4.shtml">JMRI 5.5.4</a></span>
        Custom default.lcf Logging Control Files will cease to take effect from JMRI 5.5.4
        <br>To create a custom default_lcf.xml in the new Logging Configuration format, see 
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/Debug.shtml">JMRI Debugging and Logging</a>
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.5.shtml">JMRI 5.5.5</a></span>
        XML files with table contents and panels have been changed in JMRI 5.5.5. It's therefore not
        possible to load an xml file with tables and panels that has been created with JMRI 5.5.5 or
        later with a JMRI version pre 5.5.5.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.5.shtml">JMRI 5.5.5</a></span>
        MQTT Connection - Throttle loco address and function placeholders in MQTT topics have changed from
        $address and $function to {0} and {1} for consistency with other objects.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.7.1.shtml">JMRI 5.7.1</a></span>
        Several systems have had extensive updates to their serial
        support.  If you have trouble connecting to your layout hardware
        after installing this version, please contact us
