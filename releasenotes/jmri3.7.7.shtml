      Release Notes for JMRI 3.7.7 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2014</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.7.7 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.8 production release around the middle of 2014.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<p>The decoder definition files have been reformatted to make them easier to maintain.
If you want to make a change in a decoder definition file, please start with a 
file from JMRI 3.7.6 or later.</p>

<p>The XmlIO web service has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in JMRI 3.11 (July 2015).
All users who are relying on direct access to the XmlIO API are
recommended to begin using the JSON API. inControl web throttle users are recommended to
begin using webThrottle instead, or to plan on investing in devices that can support
webThrottle, the iOS WiThrottle, or the Android Engine Driver.</p>

<p>This release series has some changes to the application-initialization structure, particularly in the 
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/JavaDoc/doc/apps/Apps.html">apps.Apps</a> class.  If you have written code of your own
that runs applications based on JMRI, please check for use of deprecated methods.</p>

<p>The internals for handling CV read and write addressing have been extensively 
reworked.  The change should be transparent (invisible) to users. If you do notice anything 
problems involving CV reading, writing, storage or anything else, please let us know.</p>

<p>The configuration structure for JMRI is changing to use <em>Configuration
Profiles</em>. Configuration Profiles allow a single JMRI application to have
multiple, user selectable, configurations that can be changed as application
startup. For some users, this change will have no impact; other users will be
visibly impacted by this change. See <a
href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/profiles.shtml">http://jmri.org/help/en/html/profiles.shtml</a>
for more information.</p>

<p>The JMRI SRCP implementation is undergoing extensive revision, in part
due to testing with 3rd party SRCP clients and servers.  
If you are using the SRCP support, 
you will need to upgrade both the client(s) and the server to the same JMRI version.</p>

<p>The JMRI Web Server is being extensively rewritten. If you notice any problems using it, please let us know.</p>

<P>This release, and all other releases in this cycle, require Java 1.6 or newer.</p>
