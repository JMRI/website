      </h1>

    <p>Date: May 10, 2025</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.11.6 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.11.* test releases.
It requires at least Java 11 to work.
We recommend that you use Java 17.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI  production release in June 2025.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<!-- 
<P>We are getting close to the next production release, so we would particularly
appreciate your testing of this release to make sure it works for you. That way,
if you find new problems, we can try to fix them before the production release.</P>
 -->

<!-- 
<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.
We would appreciate your feedback on it.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?

</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri5.10.shtml#warnings">JMRI 5.10 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 5.11 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to at least <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>
before installing this test release.
See <a href="#update">instructions above</a>.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  
        We recommend that you use Java 17.
        Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/JVMCapabilities.shtml">JVM Capabilities</a> pages.
    </li>
    <li>If you're using a Firefox web browser and opening JMRI 
        help files locally (not over the web), a Firefox bug
        can sometimes cause it to enter a loop.  There's a 
        workaround in
        <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/message/239205">this JMRIusers post</a>.
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.11.3.shtml">JMRI 5.11.3</a></span>
        There's been a change to how OpenLCB turnouts are
        addressed when using the MTT addressing short cut.
        Turnouts 253,254,255, 510, 511, 512, 765, 766 and 767
        will be addressed differently.  If you're using any of these
        via e.g. MTT253, you will need to change the address.  If you've
        been having trouble getting those addresses to work, this change should
        fix that.
        </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.11.5.shtml">JMRI 5.11.5</a></span>
        OperationsPro program file locations were changed in 
        <a href="jmri5.11.5.shtml">JMRI 5.11.5</a>. Start up actions
        involving operations windows from previous releases no longer work. You'll need to remove them and
        add them back if needed.</li>

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri5.11.5.shtml">Test Release 5.11.5</a>:</h2>

The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=milestone%3A5.11.6+is%3Amerged">full list of included changes</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.


    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated several Digitrax help pages to include
                recently introduced products, fix typos.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>There's a new storage method for event names.
                    Previously, these were stored in the IdTag table, which might
                    be confusing.
                    Starting with this release, they're separately stored
                    in an eventnames/eventNames.xml file within the user files
                    location.
                    Names that were previously stored in the IdTag table
                    will be automatically migrated to this new method.</li>
            </ul>

        <a id="CPE" name="CPE"></a>

            <li>The ability to set signal mast aspects in <em>view</em> mode is controlled by
            the <strong>Disabled</strong> setting for the signal mast icon.  When enabled, changing
            the aspect by clicking or selecting from the aspect list is blocked.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Layout Editor</h3>
        <a id="LE" name="LE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to set signal mast aspects in <em>view</em> mode is controlled by
            the <strong>Disabled</strong> setting for the signal mast icon.  When enabled, changing
            the aspect by clicking or selecting from the aspect list is blocked.</li>
            <li>The right click menu for <strong>Markers</strong> when using Linux has been fixed.</li>
            <li>Fixed editing and rendering issues with Block Contents Icons.  
                No longer need to have a value in the block to edit the Icon.  
                Rotated blocks render correctly.  
                Empty Hidden now works on initial load and after editing the panel</li>
            <li>Fixed deleting of Inline LogixNG's when Layout Panels are deleted</li>
        </ul>

            <li>New feature, passenger car blocking order for Manifests and switch lists</li>
            <li>Added car's division name to CSV Manifests and switch lists</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug when routing through staging and no last hop C/I track was available</li>
            <li>Improved the route edit window by always showing both departure time and travel time</li>
            <li>Fixed exception error when replacing a car's load using the "All" cars feature</li>
            <li>New feature, ability to show the last train that transported a car</li>
            <li>Improvements to car export, added the car's route path, previous location, track, and train</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="PE" name="PE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to set signal mast aspects in <em>view</em> mode is controlled by
            the <strong>Disabled</strong> setting for the signal mast icon.  When enabled, changing

            <li>Added a new "web/idtags_examples" directory with an example
                of icons which move to different places on the webpage depending on their most recent report.

                The principles shown could be used to show locomotives or train movements.
                See the included PDF file for more information.</li>
