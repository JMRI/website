<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

        <h4>CBUS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Command Station Monitor :
                <br>Button added to release JMRI-managed loco sessions,
                <br>this can be handy when developing Jython scripts that fail to release the Throttle.
                <br>Button added to launch a new JMRI Throttle for a loco session.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Lenz XPressNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Throttles are now fully released by JMRI when not required, which resolves an issue with
                Roster Last Operated and Operating Duration fields not being updated.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>

                    </ul>
                    Users should delete any "Roster Entries" which were created using previous 
                    decoder definitions and create new entries using these new definitions.
                </li>
                <li>LocoNet Monitor gives better information when some
                    responses were reporting "unrecognized message" for
                    CV reads of LocoNet-connected Digitrax 7th-generation
                    Accessory devices.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>MQTT</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Set the max-in-flight number to 100 to avoid overflow errors.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Update the STL Editor to support compact store output.  This allows more
                statements in a Logic group.</li>
                <li>OpenLCB_Java lib updated to release 0.8.1, which includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Better GUI for the node selection tool, which improves
                            layout of the firmware upgrade window, send tool window,
                            memory tool window and other places.
                        <li>Event ID fields now have a contextual menu to assist in
                            specifying well-known events, time (clock) events, and
                            DCC accessory decoder events.  These are also available

                <li>Improve memory tools:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allow selection of space 0 - 255 in Memory R/W tool and Send Frame Tool,
                            with data entry in either hex or decimal
                        <li>Improve display of available spaces by omitting missing spaces to reduce length of display
                    </ul>
                <li>Send Frame tool will no longer allow you to access CDI if there's no CDI in the node.
                    This prevents you from accidentally getting into a confusing situation.
                <li>Firmware Upgrade Tool and Memory Tool now let you select the memory space
                    with a decimal or hexadecimal number.
                <li>Implements the slider and action button proposal in CDI.  There are
                    no products using this, but we'll be ready when they're introduced.
                <li>Updates the OpenLCB library so that

                            will be properly displayed.</li>
                        <li>The CDI can now hint that a slider should be displayed for an integer</li>
                        <li>A bug when displaying String variables with 0x0A newline characters has been fixed</li>
                        <li>When an integer variable is displayed as a map and an unmapped value is
                            encountered, it's now displayed as "Reserved: nnn"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Fix a problem when CDI contains "immediate" slider hints</li>
                <li>Slider hints now control tick spacing, instead of number of ticks.</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug were immediate-mode sliders would sometimes
                    not automatically write their contents when changed,
                    leaving people to have to push the "Write" button.</li>
                <li>OpenLCB and LCC connections now support "DCC Signal Decoder"
                    Signal Heads.</li>
                <li>The OpenLCB and LCC implementations have started to provide a CommandStation
                    object with limited capability.</li>
                <li>STL Editor: Provide an alternate view where the IQYZ tables are in a separate
                    window. This makes it possible to see the table content while working on the
                    STL logic.</li>
                <li>STL Editor: Implement a view option to provide a preview of the generated
                    STL logic.</li>
                <li>STL Editor: Implement shift-click to copy a name from a table row to the current
                    logic row.</li>
                <li>Improved how UTF-8 is handled in CDI display.</li>

                    This will allow node implementors to make simpler configuration dialogs.</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug where the node configuration display would sometimes
                    be drawn with overlapping characters or extra white space.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>TMCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Now sends repeated function commands so long as
                    the throttle function is active.</li>
                <li>TMCC2 Legacy 200 speed step mode is now available.
                    Select it from the combo box at the top of the Throttle's speed subwindow.</li>
                <li>Add support for sending two function commands on a button
                    push/release.  First examples of this are <br/>
                    Fn28 Start Up Sequence 1 (Delayed Prime Mover, then Immediate Start Up)<br/>
                    Fn30 Shut Down Sequence 1 (Delay w/ Announcement, then Immediate Shut Down)

            <li>Will now show decoder family and model comments if you
                hover your mouse over the decoder selection tree.</li>
            <li>A problem where the Simple CV programmer would sometimes
                fail to display the proper options has been fixed.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Dispatcher</h3>
        <a id="Dispatcher" name="Dispatcher"></a>
        <ul>
             <li>For trains with HEAD ONLY detection release sections by length.</li>
             <li>When train exits section leave coloured as allocated until released.</li>
             <li>Do not release any allocated section from a train if the position of the train is not known.</li>
             <li>Add minimum reliable operating throttle setting.
             Calculate adjusted throttle as throttle * factor then apply max and min limits.
             Use Max speed from the roster entry, if available, as default.
             Refactor ActivateTrain to push the final validation and train creation into dispatcher.</li>
             <li>Speed Setting NoSignals.</li>
             <li>  After setting speed by Sections ahead. Check Block speeds.</li>
             <li>  If next block slower than current block set speed down before entering next block.</li>
             <li>  Do not increase speed beyond the minimum speed of any occupied block.</li>
             <li>When going from automatic to manual bypass auto-engineer limts.</li>
             <li>Optionally use Connections Turnout Delay.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Layout Editor</h3>
        <a id="LE" name="LE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Enable control circle colors and the fill option for slip turnouts.</li>
            <li>Improved zoom menu selection matching.</li>
            <li>Fix slip turnout control circle colors when using closed/thrown colors.</li>
            <li>The "Scale" operation on icons has been
                changed to a relative scaling from the current size.
                For example, if you've scaled an icon by 150% already,
                and request a rescaling by 200%, the icon will end up
                at 300%.  Previously, this would work inconsistently.</li>
        </ul>


    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>The expression <strong>Reporter</strong> can now use
              indirect addressing for selecting the Reporter.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>Publish</strong> in the category
              <strong>MQTT</strong> now has the option
              <strong>Retain</strong>. If the value is <strong>Default</strong>,
              the value of the connection will be used.</li>
          <li>Prepend the proper prefix when using short system names, such as 123 or abcd.  For
                alpha suffixes include the required $ character.</li>
          <li>A bug is fixed in the <strong>Timer</strong> action. The
              bug caused the timer to <strong>not</strong> start
              automatically when the tables and panel file is loaded,
              despite the <strong>Start timer immediately on load</strong>
              setting was selected for the timer.</li>
          <li>A bug is fixed that caused problem with storing a table
              and panel file if the LogixNG preference
              <strong>Install debugger</strong> is unselected.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>Throttle</strong> now has the option
              <strong>Stop loco then switching loco</strong>. If it's
              selected, the loco is stopped before switching to another
              loco.</li>
          <li>A bug is fixed in the LogixNG action <strong>Signal Mast</strong>.
              The options <strong>Permissive Sml Disabled</strong>
              and <strong>Permissive Sml Not Disabled</strong> caused
              an error when storing and loading the tables and panels
              file.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>OperationsPro</h3>
        <a id="Operations" name="Operations"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>New feature, print or preview trains serving a location or track.</li>
            <li>Locos set out to a spur or interchange now obey which train or routes service the track.</li>
            <li>Cabooses and cars with FRED without a final destination can now use staging that only allows cars with an final destination.</li>
            <li>There's now an option to leave cars in staging for trains that return to the same staging track. See "Allow cars to return to staging" for more details.</li>
            <li>There's a new Manifest feature that allows you group all "Moves" together. See "Manifest Print Options".</li>
            <li>The program now issues a warning during a build when removing a final destination due to track space issues.</li>
            <li>Changed "Wait" to travel time in the route edit window.</li>

            <li>HPT (Horse Power per Ton) in the Setting window can now accept decimal numbers.</li>
            <li>New feature, you can now control which caboose road names a train can use.</li>
            <li>New tool, "Set Locomotives", allows you to change a group of locomotives.
        </ul>

   <h3>Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="PE" name="PE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The "Scale" operation on icons has been
                changed to a relative scaling from the current size.
                For example, if you've scaled an icon by 150% already,
                and request a rescaling by 200%, the icon will end up
                at 300%.  Previously, this would work inconsistently.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Permissions</h3>
        <a id="Permissions" name="Permissions"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The permission system has been improved. Users and
                roles remains but the permissions has changed. As a
                result, you might need to set the permissions for each
                role again.</li>
            <li>If you change permissions, you need to restart JMRI for
                the changes to take effect.</li>
            <li>A new permission <strong>Panel permission</strong> is
                added. If the user doesn't have at least <strong>View</strong>
                permission, the panel will be empty with the text
                <strong>Permission denied</strong>.</li>
            <li>The JMRI web server now has support for permissions. The
                user can login and logout using the web server. Note
                that the web server has the guest user <strong>remote guest</strong>
                instead of the usual <strong>guest</strong> user. The
                remote guest user has by defaul the <strong>Remote guest</strong>
                role. This allows you to have different permissions for
                web access than local access for users that have not
                logged in.</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h3>Preferences</h3>
        <a id="Preferences" name="Preferences"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Set the bounds on the dialog when going into EditPreferences after profile connection fail.</li>
            <li>Added text to "start Up" Preferences to note that optimal XML file
                loading should be done <em>before</em> "Opening" <u>any</u>
                "Table".</li>
            <li>Do not create blank profiles.
                When deleting blank profiles do not remove directory.
                Explicitly warn that a directory and its contents will be deleted when deleting a profile.</li>
            <li>Update <strong>Messages</strong> details. Describe the option to hide tabs without active messages.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Resources</h3>
        <a id="Resources" name="Resources"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added an
                "<a href="https://jmri.org/extras">/extras/</a>"
                directory to contain large/specialized downloadable resource files.</li>
            <li>Added Jim Well's coal tipple sound file to
                <a href="https://jmri.org/extras/sounds">/extras/sounds</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Roster</h3>
        <a id="Roster" name="Roster"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>On roster media pane (as well as functions panel), 
                images can be opened by double clicking on the panel or via the contextual menu. 
                Direct images drag'n drop from any aplication is also supported, 
                a png file will be created from the drag'n drop content.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Routes</h3>
        <a id="Routes" name="Routes"></a>
       <ul>
            <li>When you're editing a Route, the window will now close when you hit Update.
                This makes this edit window behave like other ones.</li>
       </ul>

    <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <a id="Scripting" name="Scripting"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a warning that requests people
                contact us if they are using JavaScript/ECMAscript
                for JMRI scripting.  This will help us
                understand how much that feature is being used.
                <p>
                There's also a new "jython/DontWarnJavaScript.py"
                script that can be loaded at startup to 
                suppress this warning.</li>
            <li>Add the SetBlockValues.py script to the JMRI distribution.</li>
            <li>Added "jython/LifxLightControlExample.py", a sample script that shows how to 
                control LIFX strip lights via a web request.
            <li>The Jython library has been updated to version 2.7.4</li>
            <li>Added "SensorFromBxpa1ShortCircuit.py" and
                "SensorFromBxp88ShortCircuit.py" scripts, which can create
                JMRI "Internal" sensors that "follow" the LocoNet message
                information that is created when the BXPA1 and BXP88
                (respectively) send "Short Circuit" event LocoNet messages.</li>
            <li>Updated the "SensorFromBxpa1AutoRev.py" script to do a better
                job of watching for BXPA1 "Autoreverse" event LocoNet messages.</li>
            <li><strong>WiThrottleList.py</strong> is a sample script that shows how to access the
            WiThrottle session list.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Signals</h3>
        <a id="Signals" name="Signals"></a>
        <h4>Signal Systems</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>There's a new
                    <a href="https://www.jmri.org/xml/signals/basic-enhanced/">basic-enhanced signal system</a>.</li>
                <li>The
                    <a href="https://www.jmri.org/xml/signals/FS-1987/">FS-1987 signal system</a> was improved.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Throttle</h3>
        <a id="throttle" name="throttle"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a startup action to trigger the show JMRI throttle list window action.</li>
        </ul>


   <h3>Warrants</h3>
        <a id="Wt" name="Wt"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the <strong>Set Memory Value</strong> action to the Throttle Commands script.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Web Access</h3>
        <a id="WA" name="WA"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>new parameter ("protect=yes") to treat web-panel as read-only</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Web Server</h3>
        <a id="server" name="server"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>alternate "Conductor" webpage, with Id-Tag updates (eg. RFID), and showing current train composition. </li>
        </ul>

   <h3>WiThrottle Server</h3>
        <a id="WS" name="WS"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>getThrottleList()</strong> public method has been added to
            jmri.jmrit.withrottle.UserInterface for Jython access.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Virtual Sound Decoder</h3>
        <a id="VSD" name="VSD"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The limit for VSDecoders is now 8 instead of 4.</li>
            <li>The sound buttons sorting in the VSD Manager window is now as in config.xml.</li>
            <li>If the sound buttons exeed 8, a second row is displayed.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Z21 Server</h3>
        <a id="Z21" name="Z21"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fix an error that causes occasional crashes.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Updated LauchJMRI.exe to display the console when the /noisy is used. No more return code 1, but an actual explanation!</li>
            <li>The method <strong>jmri.jmrit.audio.AudioThread.alive()</strong> has been renamed to <strong>isThreadAlive()</strong>.
                It should only affect developers and people using JMRI as a library.</li>
            <li><strong>Permissions</strong>, which was added in JMRI 5.9.3,
                had a serious bug. If the user doesn't have permission to store,
                it can still store when JMRI shutdown. That bug is now fixed.</li>
            <li>New Permission user names are now case-insensitive and stored using
                lower case. Existing Permission user names are unaffected by this
                change.</li>
            <li>Trying to log in as 'guest' is now returned with a dialog.</li>
            <li>Protected against an uncommon error that can happen 
                when loading a file at startup on Windows.</li>
            <li><strong>Permissions</strong> are now added to JMRI. It
                allows you to password protect some parts of JMRI. For
                now, you can protect Load and Store of table content
                and panel files. And you can protect the preferences.
                Permissions are disabled by default so you need to
                enable them to use them. For more information, see the
                <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/permission/PermissionManager.shtml">documentation</a>.</li>
            <li>Some cleanup has been done to JMRI. It shouldn't affect
                the users, but if it does, please report it on the
                <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/topics">JMRI Users Groups.io</a>
                Group. If there is any problem, it could case JMRI to
                not quit properly, not restart properly or leave Java
                running when JMRI has quit.</li>
            <li>It's now possible for a class in JMRI to replace the
                serial port on the fly, without the rest of JMRI noticing
                it. It's useful for example for a firmware uploader that
                needs exclusive access to the serial port. For an
                example, see jmri.jmrix.loconet.demoport.DemoSerialPortAction.</li>
            <li>Linux & Mac: When finding available serial ports, JMRI now looks for symbolic
              links in /dev even when the purejavacomm.portnamepattern system property is not specified.
              Such symlinks can be used to provide a stable filename for a USB serial port.  For instance:
              <pre>
              $ ls -l /dev/serial/by-id/
              total 0
              lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Nov  7 10:32 usb-RR-CirKits_LocoBuffer-USB_FTV8GN2E-if00-port0 -> ../../ttyUSB1
              $ sudo ln -s /dev/serial/by-id/usb-RR-CirKits_LocoBuffer-USB_FTV8GN2E-if00-port0 /dev/LocoBuffer
              </pre>
              Then the Preferences panel will present 'LocoBuffer' as an available serial port, and it will remain
              available even if the port is later mapped to ttyUSB2, etc.
            </li>
            <li>Add Close button to menubar Window menu.</li>
