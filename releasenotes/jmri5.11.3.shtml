      Release Notes for JMRI 5.11.3 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: MM DDD, 2025</p>
    <p>From: release pumpkin</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.11.3 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.11.* test releases.
It requires at least Java 11 to work.
We recommend that you use Java 17.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI  production release in June 2025.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<!-- 
<P>We are getting close to the next production release, so we would particularly
appreciate your testing of this release to make sure it works for you. That way,
if you find new problems, we can try to fix them before the production release.</P>
 -->

<!-- 
<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.
We would appreciate your feedback on it.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<h3>New problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None yet</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either
wait for
<a href="jmri5.11.4.shtml">JMRI 5.11.4</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">JMRI development build installer</a>
from
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>
 -->

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>There's been a change to how OpenLCB turnouts are
        addressed when using the MTT addressing short cut.
        Turnouts 253,254,255, 510, 511, 512, 765, 766 and 767
        will be addressed differently.  If you're using any of these
        via e.g. MTT253, you will need to change the address.  If you've
        been having trouble getting those addresses to work, this change should
        fix that.
        </li>
</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri5.10.shtml#warnings">JMRI 5.10 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 5.11 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to at least <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>
before installing this test release.
See <a href="#update">instructions above</a>.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  
        We recommend that you use Java 17.
        Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/JVMCapabilities.shtml">JVM Capabilities</a> pages.
    </li>
    <li>If you're using a Firefox web browser and opening JMRI 
        help files locally (not over the web), a Firefox bug
        can sometimes cause it to enter a loop.  There's a 
        workaround in

<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.


    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Correct behavior of the ONESENSOR and TWOSENSOR turnout feedback mode. 
                    The turnout's KnownState is set after turnout feedback is received. 
                    In Layout Editor - Entry Exit - Full Interlocking - Signal mast sets the aspect Clear 
                    only after all turnouts are correctly positioned.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>LocoNet Monitor and Reporters now parse LISSY RFID-7 messages as sent by the Arduino-based GCA51
                  LocoIO 2xRFID board.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Added "Restart" and "Clear CDI cache" to the Send Frame developer screen</li>

                <li>Added overwrite mode to EventID-entry fields. This accessed by using the "insert" key, which 
                    changes the cursor to an underline so you know you're in the mode.  Mac keyboards do not
                    support an insert key, so this feature is not available on the Mac.</li>
                <li>Updated the OpenLCB library being used to version 0.8.5</li>
                <li>Improved handling of memory service timeouts, including
                    variable timeout lengths defined by the datagram responses.
                <li> Made sure that MTT style turnout addressing used the 
                    standard-compliant "linear" form.
            </ul>

        <h4>RFID</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A new method was added to receive RFID messages as IdTags over LocoNet, for example using the
                  Arduino-based GCA51 LocoIO 2xRFID board.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>SRCP</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fast-clock TIME commands now use the 00-23 format for

                    and updated HornbyTTS.xml to address error for
                    Hall Class Sound definition</li>

                 changing under a train.</li>
             <li>Identify conflicting routes when checking allocations thru DoubleXOvers with four blocks.
                 DoubleXOvers with less than four blocks require no additional checks.</li>

              returns the current system time in milliseconds and is
              useful if you want to measure how long time it takes for
              JMRI to do a task.</li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>

    <h3>OperationsPro</h3>
