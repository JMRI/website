      </h1>

    <p>Date: MMM DD, YYY</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Production Release 5.8 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<p>We are very pleased to announce that the 5.7 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production Release 5.8" available for download today.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

                	<p>
                	This required rewriting how memory addresses were managed for all NCE systems.
                	This required significant code changes for anything where JMRI is
                	addressing memory in the command stations.
                </li>
               	<li>NCE Packet Monitor - added new baud rate selection for new version of device.

               	logged to the console.</li>
               	<li>NCE Packet Analyzer has internal improvements to prevent errors due to port not
               	being open. Duplicates are now given as a count instead of a row of +++ as
               	the time stamp wasn't being placed correctly and a count is more meaningful.
               	The option to close the connection was added to manage selecting a different
               	port. It now supports the old and new versions of the analyzer. Reworked the 
               	user interaction options to be easier to use and understand.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Oak Tree</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Oak Tree serial connections have been updated to use a new serial library.</li>  
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>OpenLCB/LCC serial connections have been updated to use a new serial library.</li>  
                <li>Fixed an index exception while the Event Table is writing a CSV file.</li>
                <li>Monitor now decodes clock messages</li>
                <li>Switched CD/CDI String input fields to mono-spaced font, and 
                    limit their content length to the length of the underlying
                    configuration field.</li>
                <li>Updated script DisplayTrackCircuit.py to support the Tower +Que node
                    <p>This script populates a set of events to match the traffic circuit and then
                    creates a listener for them. That listener populates and maintains a memory to
                    show text for the state of the traffic circuit.</li>
                <li>Several tools have improved layout when the
                    screen size is reduced.</li>
                <li>Added an "ID Tool". This will cause the transmit LED on one
                    physical node to flash.  This can be a convenient way to identify which 
                    physical node underneath the layout is the one you're working with in JMRI, 
                    e.g. when you need to move a wire.
                <li>Configuration of large String fields now has an improved interface:
                    You can see how many characters remain in the large field and word
                    breaks are now respected.
                <li>The Event Table now has buttons to copy Sensor and Turnout user names
                    into the relevant Event ID names. These only fill in blank Event ID
                    names, they don't overwrite any names you might have already entered.
                <li>Fixed a bug in the event table that could cause duplicate event listings.
                <li>Updated the OpenLCB_Java library ot version 0.7.35 with improvements:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Better display of frames with leading zeros on their aliases
                        <li>Better handling of unexpected alias collisions.  These shouldn't
                            actually happen if all goes well, but just in case it doesn't...
                        <li>Adds support for the Verify Node Addressed message
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Additions for better conformance with OpenLCB standards</li>
                <li>Add the 
                    <strong>
                        <A href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/stleditor/StlEditorPane.shtml">STL Editor</a>
                    </strong>
                    tool to the OpenLCB/LCC menu.  The
                    tool is used to generate the STL logic for the RR-CirKits Tower LCC+Q.  The
                    Tower LCC+Q uses a subset of the Siemens Structured List PLC language.</li>
                <li>Improved new Turnout address validation.</li>
                <li>Updated the openlcb.jar file with 
                    <a href="https://github.com/openlcb/OpenLCB_Java/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">PRs through 265</a>.
                <li>Protected against an error that could occur on startup
                    if JMRI has trouble reaching the network interface on Windows.</li>
                <li>CDI configuration window now displays min and max values in the 
                    tooltip and enforces max/min values for integer input.
                    The "Write" button is disabled when an out-of-range input has been entered.
                <li>Improved how Datagram Acknowledged and Datagram Rejected are
                    displayed in the Monitor window.
                <li>Fixed the filtering in the Monitor window.</li>
                <li>If you enter an value that's outside the acceptable range
                    in the configuration tool, the background will now turn
                    blue to indicate that to you.</li>
                <li>Improved how the buttons are laid out at the bottom of the CDI window</li>
                <li>Improved handling and display of messages that flag Simple protocol</li>

    <h3>DecoderPro</h3>
        <a id="DecoderPro" name="DecoderPro"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a SplitHundredsVal which defines a large value
                split across multiple CVs in groups of two decimal digits.
                This is used by the new Logic Rail Tech definition.</li>
            <li>The CV table columns now expand to fill their complete pane.
                This is to make the table more readable when it contains long
                value or CV name strings.</li>
            <li>Label &amp; Media pane, throttle function button "lock" behaviour was renamed as "latch", as per <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/12975">issue #12975</a>. Documentation updated accordingly.</li>
            <li>Better handling of selected items when roster list is updated</li>
            <li>Enable/Disable bottom controls depending on selected item</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h3>PanelPro</h3>
        <a id="PanelPro" name="PanelPro"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The path for the <strong>backupPanels</strong> directory has been fixed so that it
            now refers to the user files location instead of the profile location.  This only affects
            the backup files location when user data is shared by multiple profiles.</li>

            <li>The <strong>File &rArr; Show file history</strong> content has been enhanced.  The
            <strong>app</strong> entries show the JMRI version.  The <strong>Store</strong> entries
            show the name of the file that was created.</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h3>OperationsPro</h3>
        <a id="Operations" name="Operations"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a routing bug that was introduced in JMRI 5.6</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Dispatcher</h3>
        <a id="Dispatcher" name="Dispatcher"></a>
        <ul>
             <li>Add an option to Ramp up and down using the speed profile such that the speed change takes place over the length of the section.</li>
             <li>Replace boolean ResistanceWheelSet with TrainDetection, which supports...</li>
             <li>Whole Train - the entire train is detected.</li>
             <li>Head Only - only the front of the train can be detected.</li>
             <li>Head and Tail - the front and rear are detected but not any bits in between.</li>
             <li>Any TrainInfo files that are edited will be saved in the updated way and cannot be read by older versions.</li>
             <li>ActiveTrain - now fires property change events when Allocated Section are added and removed.  Previously only fired event on add.
             <li>When finding no next allocated section, 1st check for end of transit.</li> 
             <li>Update controlling Signal on screen in a timely fashion.</li>
             <li>Stop train with profile in remaining blocks of a multi block section.</li>
             <li>Stop autotrains on program exit.</li>
             <li>Allow User to enter a train name of their choosing.</li>
             <li>Add Transit Action to attempt to allocate beyond next safe section.</li>
        </ul>


    <h3>Layout Editor</h3>
        <a id="LE" name="LE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not display tooltips for hidden items.</li>
            <li>Do not reset all tooltip settings for Always or Never tooltip selections when changing
            the editor mode.</li>
            <li>Fixed the ability to connect turnouts by dragging and dropping. When end points
            overlap, a track segment is automatically created. This works very nicely for creating
            yard ladders.  The problem affected panels on Linux and Windows.</li>
            <li>Add the <strong>hidden</strong> attribute to the Layout Editor <strong>Shape</strong>
            item.  The center popup menu has an option to hide the shape when not editing.  The
            <strong>setHidden(boolean)</strong> public method can be used by scripts and LogixNG.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Disable value edit popup when not editing</strong> menu item has been
            added to the context menus for blocks, memories and global variables.  When the panel
            is not in edit mode and the option is enabled, the pop-up to the edit the value will
            not occur.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> If tables and panels are stored
                with this JMRI version, the file might not load in a
                previous version of JMRI if it includes LogixNG. This is
                because JMRI now stores some LogixNG data in a different
                way than before.</li>
            <li>Add Audio support to Where Used.</li>
            <li>The action <strong>Local Variable</strong> can now set
                a constant of different types: <strong>String</strong>,
                <strong>Integer</strong>, <strong>Floating number</strong>,
                <strong>Boolean</strong>.</li>
            <li>The LogixNG table now shows whenether the ConditionalNGs
                of a LogixNG has <strong>Startup</strong> enabled or not.
                The <strong>Startup</strong> checkbox in the LogixNG
                table can have three states: Checked, unchecked and
                partially checked. If the user checks/unchecks the
                checkbox, all the ConditionalNGs will have the
                <strong>Startup</strong> enabled/disabled.
                <br>
                The column <strong>Startup</strong> is at the far right
                in the LogixNG table. You might need to resize the table
                to see the new column.
                <br>
                Note: Due to a bug, <strong>Startup</strong> might not
                be shown as checkboxes but of text labels that cannot be
                changed. To change <strong>Startup</strong> in this case,
                edit the LogixNG and change <strong>Startup</strong> for
                each ConditionalNG.</li>
            <li>The LogixNG table now shows whenether the ConditionalNGs
                of a LogixNG has <strong>Startup</strong> enabled or not.
                The <strong>Startup</strong> checkbox in the LogixNG
                table can have three states: Checked, unchecked and
                partially checked. If the user checks/unchecks the
                checkbox, all the ConditionalNGs will have the
                <strong>Startup</strong> enabled/disabled.
                <br>
                The column <strong>Startup</strong> is at the far right
                in the LogixNG table. You might need to resize the table
                to see the new column.</li>
                to see the new column.
                <br>
                Note: Due to a bug, this feature didn't work as it
                should in JMRI 5.7.2 but it's now fixed.</li>
            <li>A couple of bugs in the LogixNG formula parser have
                been fixed.</li>
            <li>The action <strong>Program On Main</strong> has been
                added. It lets you program CVs on the main.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>Table: For each</strong> can now loop
              thru the headers too. If indirect addressing is used for
              the row or column name, use the empty string to get the
              headers.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>Table</strong> is added. It  lets the
              user set the value of a cell in a LogixNG table.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>Request update of sensor</strong> is
              added. It requests that the state of a sensor is updated
              from the layout, if possible. Not all connections supports
              this, for example LocoNet.</li>
          <li>LogixNG has two new preferences which are disabled by default:
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Use strict typing of global variables</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Use strict typing of local variables</strong></li>
              </ul>
              If strict typing is enabled, local and global variables
              that are initialized to a string, integer or floating number
              cannot be set to a value of another type. LogixNG will try
              to convert the new value to the desired type, for example
              a local variable of type floating number will be assigned
              the value 12.0 if it's assigned 12 and it will be assigned
              the value 32. if it's assigned the string "32.5".
              <br>
              Local and global variables that are initialized to another
              type, for example array, map or LogixNG table can't be
              assigned a new value.
              <br>
              If you want to use strict typing but still want to override
              this setting for a particular local or global variable, then
              initialize this variable to <strict>None</strict>. Variables
              that are initialized to <strict>None</strict> will not have
              strict typing,
          </li>
          <li>A new preference is added that selects if the
              <strong>If Then Else</strong> action should have
              <strong>Execute on change</strong> or
              <strong>Always execute</strong> as the default.
          </li>
          <li>The expression <strong>Sensor Edge</strong> no longer
              supports indirect addressing of the sensor. It has never
              really worked since Sensor Edge needs to listen on the
              sensor and it cannot listen on a sensor if indirect
              addressing is used.<br>
              If a panel is loaded and a Sensor Edge expression uses
              indirect addressing, an error message is added to the
              log:<br>
              <strong>Error during loading Sensor Edge expression
              IQDE:AUTO:0003 due to: Addressing must be Direct</strong><br>
              where IQDE:AUTO:0003 is the system name of the expression.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>Window to front</strong> as been added.
              It brings a window to the front and can be used if you for
              example want to have an icon on a panel that moves focus to
              another window.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>Decode JSON</strong> is added. It decodes
              a JSON string in a local variable to a JsonNode tree and
              puts it in another local variable.</li>
          <li>LogixNG formula now supports JSON as well. It's in particular
              useful together with the action <strong>Decode JSON</strong>.
              A JSON dataset can be indexed as a map or as an array, for
              example by <strong>MyJson{"decoder}{"model"}[4]</strong>.
              The result is a Json text node, so use the <strong>str()</strong>
              function to convert the value to a string afterwards.</li>
               <li>Conversion to boolean has changed. Before JMRI 5.7.5,
              conversion from a string to boolean returned
              <strong>True</strong> if the string was not empty, and
              <strong>False</strong> if the string was empty. With JMRI 5.7.5,
              this has changed so that a string that's <strong>true</strong>
              (case insensitive) returns a boolean <strong>True</strong>
              and a string that's <strong>false</strong> (case insensitive)
              returns a boolean <strong>False</strong>. All other string
              values throw an exception. The earlier behaviour was not
              documented so it's unlikely that this affects users.<br>
              The old behaviour was based on how Jython converts a string
              to boolean. If you want the old behaviour, you can use the
              LogixNG formula function <strong>boolJython()</strong>.</li>
          <li>Local variables and Global variables can now be initialized
              to boolean values as well. True or false. Case insensitive.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>Log local variables</strong> now has the
              option <strong>Show class name</strong>.If it is selected,
              the name of the class will be shown after the value. This
              is useful for debugging, when you want to know the type of
              the value.</li>
          <li>The LogixNG function <strong>int()</strong> previously returned a Java
              <strong>Integer</strong> instead of a Java <strong>Long</strong>.
              This bug is now corrected. It shouldn't affect any existing
              LogixNGs. The difference between <strong>Integer</strong> and
              <strong>Long</strong> is that <strong>Long</strong> can handle
              much bigger integer values than <strong>Integer</strong>.</li>
          <li>The LogixNG action <strong>Enable/Disable LogixNG</strong>
              has been added.</li>
          <li>LogixNG formulas now supports Java arrays as well, for example
              if you use the Java method <strong>split()</strong> to split
              a string. Example:
              <br>
              <pre>
LogixNG: IQ:AUTO:0001
    ConditionalNG: IQC:AUTO:0001
        ! A
            Many
               ::: Local variable "a_b", init to String "Hello_World"
               ::: Local variable "a", init to None ""
               ::: Local variable "b", init to None ""
               ::: Local variable "a_b_array", init to None ""
                ! A1
                    Digital Formula: a_b_array = a_b.split("\_")
                ! A2
                    Digital Formula: a = a_b_array[0]
                ! A3
                    Digital Formula: b = a_b_array[1]
                ! A4
                    Log local variables
              </pre>
              </li>
          <li>The LogixNG action <strong>For each</strong> now supports
              Java arrays as well, for example the result of the expression
              <strong>a_b.split("\_")</strong>.</li>
          <li>The LogixNG action <strong>Set reporter</strong> has been
              added.</li>
          <li>The actions <strong>Listen on Beans ...</strong> have been
              updated to fix a problem when several beans changes
              state at the same time.</li>
          <li>Fixes a bug so that the methods <strong>toString()</strong>,
              <strong>getKey()</strong> and <strong>getValue()</strong>
              can be used for an item when using the action <strong>For each</strong>
              on a Map.</li>
          <li>Adds the LogixNG functions <strong>strlen()</strong> in module
              <strong>String</strong> and <strong>length()</strong> in module
              <strong>Common</strong>.</li>
          <li>Bug fix: The LogixNG function <strong>boolJython()</strong>
              now return false if the value is an empty array. It returns
              true if the value is a non empty array.</li>
          <li>Bug fix: The LogixNG function <strong>evaluateMemory()</strong>
              didn't behaved as documented. It's now fixed.</li>
          <li>The LogixNG functions <strong>cos()</strong>, <strong>tan()</strong>,
              <strong>atan()</strong>, <strong>sqr()</strong> and
              <strong>sqrt()</strong> has been added to the <strong>Math</strong>
              module.</li>
          <li>A bug has been fixed in LogixNG when using LogixNG tables:<br>
              If an action or expression, for example the action <strong>Set turnout</strong>,
              reads data from a LogixNG table, for example the name of the turnout, and a
              memory is used for addressing the row or column in the table, the name of the
              memory was stored in the wrong place in the file. JMRI deals with this when
              the file is loaded so no user should be affected.<br>
              But if an existing file is loaded and then stored, the file will not work
              with JMRI versions pre 5.7.6.</li>
          <li>ConditionalNGs can now be enabled/disabled by editing a LogixNG.</li>
          <li>Scripts invoked by a ConditionalNG or Module can access <strong>current</strong> local
              variables.  This makes it possible to use local variables as parameters for Jython scripts.
              See <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/tools/logixng/reference/chapter13.shtml">
              LogixNG Reference Chapter 13</a> for details.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>Window to front</strong> has been improved and renamed to
              <strong>Window management</strong>. It can now show/hide a window,
              maximize/normalize/minimize a window and move the window to front or back.</li>
          <li>The class <strong>jmri.jmrit.logixng.actions.NamedBeanType</strong> has been moved to
              <strong>jmri.jmrit.logixng.NamedBeanType</strong>. It should only affect JMRI developers.</li>
          <li>The functions <strong>round()</strong>, <strong>ceil()</strong>
              and <strong>floor()</strong> has been added to the Math module.
              All three rounds a floating point value. ceil() rounds up and
              floor() rounds down.</li>
          <li>The constant <strong>oblocks</strong> has been added to
              the Layout module.</li>
          <li>Fixes a bug in LogixNG formula when calling a Java method that
              takes a boolean as parameter, like <strong>setVisible()</strong>.</li>
          <li>Two new preferences have been added. <strong>Log all before</strong>
              and <strong>Log all after</strong>. If these are selected,
              LogixNG will log every action that's executed and every
              expression that's evaluated. For this to work, the LogixNG
              debugger must be installed (which it is by default).</li>
          <li>In panel file print routine (XSLT), separate out "inline" LogixNGs from table-based.</li>
          <li>Add an <strong>Examples</strong> section to the LogixNG Reference.</li>
          <li>Add the <strong>Set a yard ladder</strong> example to the Examples section.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>Program On Main</strong> is improved.
              It's now possible to select long or short address. It's
              also possible to select not to wait until programming is
              completed.</li>
          <li>For most actions and expressions, when selecting indirect addressing
              of an enum, the button <strong>Show valid names</strong> are added.
              Pressing this button opens a dialog that shows a list of valid values
              and their descriptions.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>Execute action</strong> has been added. It executes
              another action somewhere else in the ConditionalNG tree. This can be
              useful if you need to execute a part of the ConditionalNG at several
              different places, for example if you have several
              <strong>Listen On Beans - Local variable</strong> in the same
              ConditionalNG.<br/>
              Note that the action you want to execute must have
              a user name. Otherwise the action can't be selected.</li>
          <li>The LogixNG tools menu now has the option to browse All LogixNGs.
              Open <strong>Tools &rArr; LogixNG &rArr; Browse All LogixNGs</strong>.
              It lists all the LogixNGs, Modules, Tables and Global variables.</li>
          <li>The option <strong>Print disabled</strong> has been added to the LogixNG
              Browse window. It adds "Disabled" to the LogixNGs, ConditionalNGs, actions
              and expressions which are disabled.</li>

            <li>Do not display tooltips for hidden items.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Disable value edit popup when not editing</strong> menu item has been
            added to the context menus for blocks, memories and global variables.  When the panel
            is not in edit mode and the option is enabled, the pop-up to the edit the value will
            not occur. The option does not apply to input and spinner icons.</li>

                known state (the default old behavior) or its commanded state
                checked to see if the route should be set.  This can be useful
                e.g. if you have feedback set on the turnout and want to react
                quickly to a commanded change.</li>
       </ul>

    <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <a id="Scripting" name="Scripting"></a>
