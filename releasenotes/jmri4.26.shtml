      Release Notes for JMRI 4.26 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: December 16, 2021</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Production Release 4.26 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<p>We are very pleased to announce that the 4.25 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production Release 4.26" available for download today.</p>

<a id="note" name="note"></a>
<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<p class="noted"><b>This is the last JMRI production or test version that will work with Java 1.8.</b><br>
To use any future JMRI test or production releases, you'll have to
update the Java on your computer to Java 11 (download from
<a href="https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk11">here</a>
or
<a href="https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&package=jre">here</a>)
This version has been tested on Java 11, so you can do the Java update now if you want to.

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.20, please follow these instructions carefully:
<!-- Note:  At this point, we're not requiring an update to 4.22; change if needed-->
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later relese.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either
wait for
<a href="jmri4.26.1.shtml">JMRI 4.26.1</a>, due out shortly,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a

<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.25.4.shtml">JMRI 4.25.4</a></span>
        If you use a Safari browser on macOS X, the local
        help system might not work.  There are two
        workarounds:
        <ol>
        <li>If your computer is connected to the internet, use
            the web-based help.  Go to JMRI Preferences, then
            select Help on the left, then click "Open help pages online";
            save and restart
        <li>To get local access, you can select Safari's Preferences,
            then the Advanced pane, then checkmark "Show Develop menu in menu bar"
            </ol>
        If you're using another browser, like Chrome or Firefox, you
        shouldn't encounter this issue.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.20.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.20 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.21 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>
before installing this release.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21.1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo class has become a jmri.SystemConnectionMemo
        interface and a jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo class. This may
        require changes to scripts.  If you have a script that references
        jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo, please change it to either
        jmri.SystemConnectionMemo or jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo
        (it's easier to have you just try the two than to explain which
        one will work in which case)
    </li>

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21.1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The way preferences are loaded at startup has been slightly
        modified.  There is no impact to JMRI applications, but Non-JMRI
        applications that are not derived from apps.Apps or apps.AppsBase
        but are using jmri.implementation.JmriConfigurationManager to load
        preferences will no longer see preferences if an error occurs.  To
        restore the old behavior, use apps.AppsConfigurationManager instead.
    </li>

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
        There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
        <ul>
            <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li>
            <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li>
            <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li>
            <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li>
            <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li>
        </ul>
        Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
        open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.
    </li>
</ul>

            <li>Moved the keyboard shortcut implementation from KeyListeners to Input and Action Maps, should work better</li>
            <li>Fixed a problem with function keys due to changes in Java 8u311</li>
            <li>Added ControlPanel.getSpeedSlider() for scripting</li>
            <li>Added default throttle file preference, will be loaded when a new throttle is acquired and no specific roster entry exist for the used address</li>
            <li>Documentation update</li>
            <li>Minor bug fixes : Modifier keys were not showing on the keyboard control preferences screen and preference apply was not done immediately for throttle list window</li>
            <li>Removed the global preference "Hide speed step selector" as it is available per throttle. Less complexity.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Transits</h3>
        <a id="Transit" name="Transit"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Transits can now have unlimited number of sections.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Turnouts, Lights, Sensors and other elements</h3>
        <a id="TLae" name="TLae"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Light Controllers triggered by Turnout now have Turnout stored in xml by DisplayName (
            UserName, or SystemName if no userName set ), rather than SystemName.</li>
        </ul>

  <h3>Warrants</h3>
        <a id="Wt" name="Wt"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Loss of control when train loses occupation detection
             (dirty track or pickup, unreliable sensor, etc) is fixed.
             Formerly trains could run uncontrolled at their current speed
             setting. An emergency stop is made and speed is set to zero
             upon loss of detection.</li>
            <li>Calculation of ramp times and distances is improved. However,
              the need for good data of path lengths and train speed profiles
              remains.</li>
            <li>The occasional freeze of the Warrant List Table is fixed.</li>
            <li>The address column of the Warrant List table is changed to show a
             roster id instead of the DCC address.  Un-rostered addresses may still be
             entered and the warrants run with such engines. In this case, the column
             entry is the address bracketed with $ signs.</li>
            <li>Warrant activity can be "traced" on the console. An Enable/Disable
             button in Warrant Preferences activates this feature. Default is
             tracing disabled.</li>
            <li>"Slow Speed Assistance" can be given when a train is inordinately
             late in getting to the next block of the script. This done only when train
             approaching the block has a speed less than a configurable percentage
             of throttle. If the train
             has not reached the block within 10 seconds of its scheduled script time,
             its speed is increased by one "Ramp Step Throttle Increment". This is
             done at 10 second intervals until either the train reaches the block or has
             attained the configurable percentage throttle speed.
             Upon entering the block the original script speed is restored.
             <br>This feature will allow balky engines with poor low speed characteristics
             to reach their destinations without stalling. The default throttle
             percentage for triggering Slow Speed Assistance is 2.5% and
             may be changed in Warrant Preferences. Slow Speed Assistance is disabled
             by setting this trigger speed to 0%.</li>
            <li>Fixed a problem found in JMRI 4.25.7
                with stopping logic.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The JavaHelp system has been replaced by JmriHelp.
            See the <a href="/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Help.shtml">Help page</a> for details.</li>
            <li>PanelPro main menu updates
              <ul>
              <li>Moved the <strong>Virtual Sound Decoder</strong> menu from the
              <strong>Debug</strong> menu to the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
              <li>Moved <strong>Start WiThrottle Server</strong> and <strong>Start JMRI Web Server</strong>
              from <strong>Debug</strong> to <strong>Tools &rArr; Servers</strong>.</li>
              <li>Updated website help pages including adding a section about the
              PanelPro menus to the main PanelPro help page.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The length of logging lines sent to the system console has been reduced
                by no longer including the date.  The time is still included.
                If you have a copy of the 'default.lcf' file in your local JMRI
                setting directory, you won't see this change until you update it.</li>
            <li>Access to the deprecated SecurityManager class has been removed;
                Java access security is now enforced by default.</li>
            <li>Keith Usher provided a new
                <a href="http://jmri.org/resources/icons/mediumschematics/searchlights/">mediumschematics searchlights icon set</a>
                at resources/icons/mediumschematics/searchlights/
            </li>
            <li>Fixed a problem with throttle function keys due to changes in Java 8u311</li>
            <li>Limited support for native running on Apple Silicon is now available.
            	Please note:
            	<ul>
            	<li>Anya DMX support doesn't work.  We recommend
            	    that you don't try to configure that hardware, as
            	    crashes have been reported.
            	<li>There is no support for the JInput library, which is
            		used for JInput-specific connections.
            	<li>There is no support for the BlueCove library, which is
            		used for Digitrax over BlueTooth connections.
            	<li>Sound support is currently limited, with work
            		on-going.
            	</ul>
            	JMRI runs fine, without the above limitations, in Rosetta
            	(Intel emulation) mode on Apple Silicon macs.
            	To run JMRI in native mode:
            	<ol>
            	<li>Install an Apple Silicon Java from
            		<a href="https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-8-lts&os=macos&architecture=arm-64-bit&package=jdk">Azul</a>.
            	<li>If needed, remove any
            		Intel-mode Java installations.
            		(These may cause JMRI to start
            		in Intel-emulation mode)
            	<li>Make sure you have Rosetta 2 installed.
            		macOS requires this to launch a
            		JMRI application from its app icon.
            		(See FB9730830)
            	</ol>
            	If you want to check whether JMRI is running in
            	Apple Silicon native more or Intel emulation
            	mode, select Context... from the JMRI Help menu.
            	Then look for the `os.arch` value about 2/3 of the
            	way down.  If it's `aarch64`, JMRI is running on
            	Apple Silicon natively. `x86_64` indicates Intel-simulation
            	mode.
            <li>Basic support for TypeScript has been added to the
                webserver file system.</li>
            <li>Users that have HighDPI scaling set to something
                different than 100% can now select whenether or not
                to force Java to use 100% scaling. To change it, go
                to <i>Edit -> Preferences -> Display</i>. The checkbox
                has the text <i>Force 100% scaling when the OS uses
                higher scaling</i>.</li>
            <li>Fix error after deleting a Memory
                and suppressing messages.
            </li>
        </ul>
