    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.24 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<p>We are very pleased to announce that the 4.23 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production Release 4.24" available for download today.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.20, please follow these instructions carefully:
<!-- Note:  At this point, we're not requiring an update to 4.22; change if needed-->
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later relese.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>NOTE RE Java 8 Version 311:  DO NOT INSTALL THIS VERSION.</strong>
      Errors have been reported which can be fixed by reverting to version 301, upgrading to Java 11,
      or installing
      <a href="jmri4.25.5.shtml">JMRI 4.25.5</a> or any later version.</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either
wait for
<a href="jmri4.19.6.shtml">JMRI 4.19.6</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        None yet
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.20.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.20 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.21 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>
installing this test release.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21.1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo class has become a jmri.SystemConnectionMemo
        interface and a jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo class. This may
        require changes to scripts.  If you have a script that references
        jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo, please change it to either
        jmri.SystemConnectionMemo or jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo
        (it's easier to have you just try the two than to explain which
        one will work in which case)
    </li>

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21.1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The way preferences are loaded at startup has been slightly
        modified.  There is no impact to JMRI applications, but Non-JMRI
        applications that are not derived from apps.Apps or apps.AppsBase
        but are using jmri.implementation.JmriConfigurationManager to load
        preferences will no longer see preferences if an error occurs.  To
        restore the old behavior, use apps.AppsConfigurationManager instead.
    </li>

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
        There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
        <ul>
            <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li>
            <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li>
            <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li>
            <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li>
            <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li>
        </ul>
        Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
        open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.
    </li>
</ul>

                LocoNet for messages pertaining to BXPA1 autoreverse events and
                updates a JMRI sensor to reflect the state.  When monitoring a
                specific BXPA1 (by BoardID), one JMRI sensor is used.  When
                monitoring all BXPA1 devices, a separate JMRI sensor is defined
                for each reporting BXPA1 device.  Further details on script
                configuration and some known limitations may be found in the
                comments included within the script's code.</li>

    <h3>Signals</h3>
        <a id="Signals" name="Signals"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Updated link in documentation</li>
            <li>Mark Ziebell made some corrections to the AAR-1946 appearance info.</li>
            <li>Mark Ziebell added a CCOR-1967 signal system.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Signal Systems</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>CCOR-1967 updated by Mark Ziebell</li>
            </ul>

	    <h4>Cab Signals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Better set row height in table.</li>
            </ul>

    	<h4>Simple Signal Logic</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The SSL tool has been updated to include the ability to
                <strong>delete</strong> a SSL defintion.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Throttle</h3>
        <a id="throttle" name="throttle"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Under the hood code clean up for  throttles (all systems), safe release of throttles.</li>
            <li>Function Panel now displays all functions buttons at once, with a scrollbar if required</li>
            <li>There are as many function buttons as defined by the used throttle</li>
            <li>Added an entry in function buttons icons contextual menu that will open a system file manager located into the JMRI functions icons library (allows easy drag'n drop</li>
            <li>If an existing icon file (same name, same size) is aded an icon, it will no longer be duplicated, existing instance will be used</li>
            <li>Keyboard shortcuts now available on whole throttle window</li>
            <li>Keyboard shortcuts can be customized in JMRI throttle preferences screen (second pane, warning, no consistency check is made)</li>
            <li>Mousewheel speed control now available on whole throttle window</li>
            <li>One mousewheel scroll unit will increment or decrement throttle speed by one speed setting increment (depends on the throttle speed step setting)</li>
            <li>Use Ctrl key to apply a multiply factor on speed increment/decrement (customizable in JMRI throttle preferences screen)</li>
            <li>Function and Control panels property panes reworked</li>
            <li>Function button with images can be resized in button property panel</li>
            <li>Function button customizations correctly serialized</li>
            <li>Ticks on graphical speed slider</li>
            <li>Pressing Enter in AddressPanel when entering an address will actually request it</li>
            <li>Jythons scripts with direct access to the JMRI UI are now deprecated (AAR105.py, RailDriver.py, USBThrottle.py, xboxThrottle.py). Use USBThrottleAsJynstrument.py script instead, or direct Jynstrument in <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/tree/master/jython/Jynstruments/ThrottleWindowToolBar/USBThrottle.jyn">jython/Jynstruments/ThrottleWindowToolBar/USBThrottle.jyn</a> , specific drivers are proposed for AAR105 and Raildriver, they may have to be adjusted.</li>
            <li>When &quot;Use large speed slider and control buttons&quot; is enabled, throttle control panel buttons (and slider) will resize automatically to leverage available space in throttle control panel</li>
            <li>When "Large speed slider" mode is enabled (in throttle preferences), directions, stop and estop buttons will automatically resize and scale depending on the control panel inner window size : allows for high visibility from far away (for people using a wireless device combined with JMRI native throttles for instance)</li>
            <li>Function buttons icons, SVG file format now supported, allows for smooth scaling</li>
            <li>Throttle control panel button icons are now based on SVG files, allows better scaling</li>
            <li>Throttle preferences are now be applied live, no need to reload the throttle windows or restart the application</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Turnouts, Lights, Sensors and other elements</h3>
        <a id="TLae" name="TLae"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed Duplication of Sensors in Sensor Table views. Bug introduced in 4.23.3</li>
            <li>Fixed Sensor Table sort issues with Delay to Active, Delay to InActive columns.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Virtual Sound Decoder</h3>
        <a id="VSD" name="VSD"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduced audio buffer consumption for Diesel sounds.</li>
            <li>Minimum time for a sub-buffer increased from 100 to 150 milliseconds.</li>
            <li>Fixed bug with last accel-limit values less than 100 in config.xml.</li>
            <li>Audio buffers and sources now are removed when a VSDecoder is deleted.</li>
            <li>Deprecated methods in VSDecoderManager: getVSDecoder(String profile_name, String path),
            getNumberOfDecoders, setDefaultVSDecoder, getDefaultVSDecoder.
            And in VSDecoder: setDefault, isDefault.</li>
            <li>Added the option "dynamic gain" for steam1. See the
            <a href="https://jmri.org/help/en/manual/DecoderPro/VSD_File_and_Config.shtml#dynamic-gain">documentation</a>
