      Release Notes for JMRI 4.99.5 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: April 9, 2022</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.99.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 4.99.* test releases to migrate JMRI to Java 11.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.0 production release at the end of Spring 2022.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.24, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>New problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>When opening a Throttle, you may get an erroneous error dialog.  You can just
        dismiss it and continue.  If you'd like to avoid it in future (until we get it fixed),
        once you have the throttle open click "File -> Save Current Throttle".
        This is GitHub
        <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/10874">Issue 10874</a> and the fix is
        <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/10875">PR 10875</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

If this affects you, please either
wait for
<a href="jmri4.99.6.shtml">JMRI 4.99.6</a>,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">JMRI development build installer</a>
from
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<ul>

<li>None yet

</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.26.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.26 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.99 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>
before installing this test release.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.2.shtml">JMRI 4.99.2</a></span>
        Example scripts related to MQTT moved from jython directory to jython\MQTT directory.  This will require
        an update to any start-up actions that reference their location.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/JVMCapabilities.shtml">JVM Capabilities</a> pages.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        A number of classes and methods that have been deprecated for a long time
        are removed in this release.  These include:
        <ul>
            <li>apps.JmriPlugin</li>
            <li>apps/startup/StartupActionFactory</li>
            <li>Routes/Turnouts/Sensors: One form of getNextAddress</li>
            <li>Handling of preferences from before JMRI 4.0; upgrade through JMRI 4.20 instead</li>
            <li>ShutDownTask, AbstractShutDownTask - use call & run methods now</li>
            <li>Removed JythonAutomaton, JythonAutomatonAction, JythonSiglet, JythonSigletAction
                unused classes.  These have been made obsolete by JMRI's native scripting,
                and haven't been used since JMRI 1.2
            </li>
            <li>SSL (BlockBossLogic) - change to start/stop calls</li>
            <li>Various TrafficManagers.instance methods - use InstanceManager</li>
            <li>Throttle.getListeners() - use getPropertyChangeListeners</li>
            <li>Removed obsolete RosterRecorder class;
                function now available via scripting
            </li>
            <li>Removed deprecated methods from Throttle panels</li>
            <li>Manager.getSystemNameList - rework with getNamedBeanSet</li>
            <li>Manager.getNamedBeanList - rework with getNamedBeanSet</li>
            <li>Manager.setPropertyChangesMuted - use setPropertyChangesSilenced</li>
            <li>Manager.getBeanBySystemName - use getBySystemName</li>
            <li>Manager.getBeanByUserName - use getByUserName</li>
            <li>FileChooserUtil</li>
            <li>get/setFontFamily in SystemConsolePreferencesManager</li>
            <li>throttle.FunctionPanel#changeState(..) has been replaced by #setSelected(..)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        The PowerManager now only fires events with the id "power".  Before this
        release, it also fired events with the id "Power". Check that
        your scripting code is looking for the right form.
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This version no longer reads ZeroConf IPv4 and IPv6 preferences
        written with JMRI 4.16 and before.  Please make sure to upgrade
        to JMRI 4.20 (or later) and save your preferences before
        updating to this version if you have configured the WiThrottle preference pane.</li>

    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>
        <h4>CBUS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The consist tool is now available for the Pi-SPROG 3v2 in command station mode, the SPROG 3 Plus and the MERG CANCMD.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>KPF-Zeller</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved the speed calibration</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Configuration - Permit disabling of interrogate messages.</li>
                <li>Slotmonitor - better guess the column widths</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>MERG</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The consist tool is now available for CBUS.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Throttle support.</b> JMRI Throttles can now operate
                OpenLCB locomotives on OpenLCB / LCC Command Stations via the
                Traction Protocol draft.</li>
                <li><b>Monitor Log updates.</b> Decodes and prints the Traction
                Protocol messages in the Monitor Log window.</li>
                <li><b>Accessibility changes.</b> The network browser / tree is
                now navigable using keyboard shortcuts. On the Configuration
                Editor panel the keys F6 and Shift+F6 can be used to navigate
                between subsequent sections of the configuration and the bar of
                buttons at the bottom.</li>
                <li><b>Test Event button.</b> In the Configuration Editor the
                Event panels have a new button More... which opens a
                dropdown. In the dropdown there is a Trigger button which sends
                the given event. This is useful for testing. In the same
                dropdown there is a Create Sensor button which for JMRI will
                create a single-event sensor.</li>
                <li><b>Bug fixes.</b> Fixes memory leak when opening many
                different nodes' Configuration Editor windows. The CAN
                Interface engine now correctly supports sending a message to a
                Destination Node ID for which there is no currently registered
                Alias in the Alias Map. The outgoing message will be enqueued
                and an alias lookup interaction is triggered.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>SPROG</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The consist tool is now available for the Pi-SPROG 3v2 in command station mode and for the SPROG 3 Plus.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>New / Updated decoder definitions</h3>

            appears that lets you open a throttle for a particular connection.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Virtual Sound Decoder</h3>
        <a id="VSD" name="VSD"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a new version of "advanced location following". This is now based
            on a LayoutEditor panel and hence much easier to setup. See the
            <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/manual/DecoderPro/VSD_LocationsMgr.shtml#advanced_location_following">
			documentation</a> for details.</li>

                <li>Improved speed matching algorithm
                <li>Updated docs
                </ul>
        </ul>
