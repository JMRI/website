      Release Notes for JMRI 5.13.4 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: MM DDD, 2025</p>
    <p>From: release pumpkin</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.13.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.13.* test releases.
It requires at least Java 11 to work.
We recommend that you use Java 17.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI  production release in December 2025.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<!-- 
<P>We are getting close to the next production release, so we would particularly
appreciate your testing of this release to make sure it works for you. That way,
if you find new problems, we can try to fix them before the production release.</P>
 -->

<!-- 
<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.
We would appreciate your feedback on it.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>New problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None yet</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either
wait for
<a href="jmri5.13.3.shtml">JMRI 5.13.3</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">JMRI development build installer</a>
from
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>None yet
</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri5.12.shtml#warnings">JMRI 5.12 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 5.13 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to at least <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>
before installing this test release.
See <a href="#update">instructions above</a>.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  
        We recommend that you use Java 17.
        Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/JVMCapabilities.shtml">JVM Capabilities</a> pages.
    </li>
    <li>If you're using a Firefox web browser and opening JMRI 
        help files locally (not over the web), a Firefox bug
        can sometimes cause it to enter a loop.  There's a 
        workaround in
        <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/message/239205">this JMRIusers post</a>.
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.11.3.shtml">JMRI 5.11.3</a></span>
        There's been a change to how OpenLCB turnouts are
        addressed when using the MTT addressing short cut.
        Turnouts 253,254,255, 510, 511, 512, 765, 766 and 767
        will be addressed differently.  If you're using any of these
        via e.g. MTT253, you will need to change the address.  If you've
        been having trouble getting those addresses to work, this change should
        fix that.
        </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.11.5.shtml">JMRI 5.11.5</a></span>
        OperationsPro program file locations were changed in 
        <a href="jmri5.11.5.shtml">JMRI 5.11.5</a>. Start up actions
        involving operations windows from previous releases no longer work. You'll need to remove them and
        add them back if needed.</li>

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri5.13.3.shtml">Test Release 5.13.3</a>:</h2>

The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=milestone%3A5.13.4+is%3Amerged">full list of included changes</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.


    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>
       <h4>DCC++ and DCC-EX</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Change DCC-EX heartbeat from &lt;s&gt; to &lt;#&gt;, requested by DCC-EX team</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>DecoderPro</h3>
        <a id="DecoderPro" name="DecoderPro"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>When working with a single roster entry, there's a 
                new "Comments" page. You can pop that off (using the 
                page icon in the tab) and enter your comments there 
                as you configure the values in the other panes.
                What you type there will appear in the comment field
                on the Roster Entry pane and vice versa.</li>
            <li>Detachable panes no longer appear in the Windows menu
                <i>unless</i> they are actually detached.</li>
            <li>Added Help and Windows menus to the detached panes.</li>
            <li>It's now possible to disable Programming Track and/or
                Programming On Main. See Preferences -> Roster ->
                Programmer.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Dispatcher</h3>
        <a id="Dispatcher" name="Dispatcher"></a>
        <ul>
             <li>The RosterSpeedProfile has been corrected to improve calculations for stopping.
                 If you have manually compensated for those errors you may want to re-evaluate
                 the Min/Max throttle settings and stopping distance percentage.</li>
             <li>The F-Numbers for Transit Section Actions for Light, Bell and Horn can be set on a per train basis.</li>
             <li>Fix bug delayed start actions not working when using speed profile ramping</li>
             <li>When creating/editing a transit you may now set the forward and reverse stopping distances
                 for individual sections. The forward and reverse refer to the direction thru the transit not
                 the direction thru the section (this differs from fwd/rev stopping sensors).
                 These are expressed in per cent and are in addition to the adjustment
                 specified when defining a train.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Layout Editor</h3>
        <a id="LE" name="LE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>A problem with LE track drawing and background images from 5.11.6 thru 5.13.3 including 5.12 has been fixed.
                The problem appears if you have a background image in the Layout Editor. If so, the track disappears behind
                the background image.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

    <h3>OperationsPro</h3>
        <a id="Operations" name="Operations"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added "Show Locomotives" to edit locations and tracks tools</li>
            <li>New feature, Track Priority. Cars on a higher priority track get serviced first when building trains.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Roster</h3>
        <a id="Roster" name="Roster"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>RosterSpeedProfile. Improve accuracy of calculations for stopping.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Throttle</h3>
        <a id="throttle" name="throttle"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>If the selected locomotive has more than 33 functions defined,
                the Function Panel will switch to a tabbed layout to make 
                the functions easier to locate.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Updated OpenLCB_Java library to version 0.8.6, which is 
                just a bookkeeping update without functional changes.</li>
        </ul>
