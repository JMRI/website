      Release Notes for JMRI 5.15.1 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: MM DD, 2025</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.15.1 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.15.* test releases.
It requires at least Java 11 to work.
We recommend that you use Java 21 if possible.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java</a>)
We expect this series to result in the next JMRI  production release in July 2026.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<!-- 
<P>We are getting close to the next production release, so we would particularly
appreciate your testing of this release to make sure it works for you. That way,
if you find new problems, we can try to fix them before the production release.</P>
 -->

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.
We would appreciate your feedback on it.</p>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  
        We recommend that you use Java 21.
        Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the

            </ul>

    <h3>DecoderPro</h3>
        <a id="DecoderPro" name="DecoderPro"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a problem causing the starting value when doing
                CV reads to erroneously be zero.</li>
            <li>When opening a roster entry with a large decoder definition,
                DecoderPro now defers some of the processing until later while
                opening the tabbed programming panes sooner.  You may see a
                pane with "Wait for pane contents to be loaded".  The contents
                should appear within a few seconds.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Dispatcher</h3>
        <a id="Dispatcher" name="Dispatcher"></a>
        <ul>
             <li>Defer calling "loadAtStartup" until the layout data file loading is done and
             layout block paths have been initialized.</li>
			 <li>Create, terminate, open throttle, extend, terminate from LEPanel.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Warning</strong><br/>
              Tables and panels files created with this version or later
              and that's using the LogixNG action <strong>Error</strong>
              cannot be opened in earlier JMRI versions.</li>
          <li>The LogixNG action <strong>Error</strong> has an improved
              error message which allows using a local variable or a
              formula for the error message.</li>
          <li>LogixNG Tables can now be placed on Panel Editor panels.
              The table can be read-only, editable or that only some
              columns are editable. It's also possible to have buttons
              and comboboxes in the table on the panel.</li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="PE" name="PE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>LogixNG Table</strong>s can now be added to a
                Panel Editor. The table can be edited and that's is useful
                if the user needs to change values in a table.<br/>
                It's recommended to use <strong>Fixed size</strong> for
                the LogixNG Table on the panel. To move the table, use
                <strong>Set Location</strong> since it's not currently
                possible to move the table on the panel using the mouse.<br/>
                The width of the columns can be changed by dragging the
                divider of the column headers. The new width will be
                stored when the tables and panels file is stored.<br/>
                The table is <u>not</u> stored when the tables and
                panels file is stored.<br/>
                It's optional to use a LogixNG Module to validate input
                from the user. If a LogixNG Module is selected, it will
                be called after the user has edited a cell, before the
                new data is written to the cell. If the data is invalid,
                the Module can abort the editing by calling the new
                LogixNG action <strong>Validation Error</strong> in the
                category <strong>Flow Control</strong>. It's possible
                to add an error message to the <strong>Validation Error</strong>
                to be shown to the user.<br/>
                A <strong>LogixNG Table</strong> on a Panel Editor panel
                can also have buttons and comboboxes. If the user clicks
                on a button, the validation module can then do something.
                And a combobox allows the user to select an item from a
                list instead of typing it.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <a id="Scripting" name="Scripting"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>TransitActionsReport.py</strong> has been added. It is used to display
            the transit section actions.  When the script is run, a dialog displays the list of
            transits.  If none are selected, a complete report is created.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Throttle</h3>
        <a id="throttle" name="throttle"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a problem causing the Function Panel's buttons
                to be improperly laid out.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Web Server</h3>
        <a id="server" name="server"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>JSON Schema support has been upgraded from draft-04 to draft-2020-12,
                providing improved validation capabilities and modern schema features
                for JSON API responses. This includes updates to 95 JSON schema files
                and the underlying NetworkNT JSON Schema Validator library (from 1.0.28 to 1.3.3).</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>(Developer) Updated build.xml so Ant builds work with Java 25</li>
            <li>(Developer) Updated SpotBugs checker to version 4.9.8.  If you use Ant
                to do SpotBugs checks locally, i.e. by running "ant spotbugs-check",
                you will need to update your local version to 4.9.8.  See our
                <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/SpotBugs.shtml">SpotBugs page</a>.
            <li>(Developer) JMRI distributions, starting with this one, will now
                be built with the Java 11.0.29 JDK.</li>
            <li>The jSerialComm library that JMRI uses has been updated from version
                2.10.4 to version 2.11.4.
        </ul>
