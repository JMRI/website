      Release Notes for JMRI 5.12 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: June 20, 2025</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Production Release 5.12 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<p>We are very pleased to announce that the 5.11 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production Release 5.10" available for download today.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>New problems with this release</h3>

<ul>
    <li>OperationsPro. After upgrading, you must reset or terminate all trains before building new ones with this release. Fixed in 5.13.1.</li>
</ul>


If this affects you, please either
wait for
<a href="jmri5.13.1.shtml">JMRI 5.13.1</a>, due out shortly,
or pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this production release:</h3>

<ul>
    <p>None Yet
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri5.10.shtml#warnings">JMRI 5.10 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 5.11 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>
before installing this release, see above.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.7.1.shtml">JMRI 5.7.1</a></span>
        Several systems have had extensive updates to their serial
        support.  If you have trouble connecting to your layout hardware
        after installing this version, please contact us
        <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">on the JMRIusers list</a>
        for assistance.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.7.7.shtml">JMRI 5.7.7</a></span>
        If you are using a RR-CirKits LocoNet to LCC gateway
        with this release, please upgrade its firmware
        to version B8g or later.  B8f or earlier will 
        have trouble updating the gateway's configuration.</li>
    <li>If you're using a Firefox web browser and opening JMRI 
        help files locally (not over the web), a Firefox bug
        can sometimes cause it to enter a loop.  There's a 
        workaround in
        <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/message/239205">this JMRIusers post</a>.
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.11.3.shtml">JMRI 5.11.3</a></span>
        There's been a change to how OpenLCB turnouts are
        addressed when using the MTT addressing short cut.
        Turnouts 253,254,255, 510, 511, 512, 765, 766 and 767
        will be addressed differently.  If you're using any of these
        via e.g. MTT253, you will need to change the address.  If you've
        been having trouble getting those addresses to work, this change should
        fix that.
        </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.11.5.shtml">JMRI 5.11.5</a></span>
        OperationsPro program file locations were changed in 
        <a href="jmri5.11.5.shtml">JMRI 5.11.5</a>. Start up actions
        involving operations windows from previous releases no longer work. 
        You'll need to remove them and
        add them back if needed.</li>

            </ul>

        <h4>CBUS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The default CAN ID for new connections is restored to 126</li>
                <li>Node Manager highlights duplicate CAN IDs.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>DCC++ and DCC-EX</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Create and update Meters for newer Current messages <JI>, <JG>, etc.</li>
                <li>Add parsing for JR, jR, JA and jA messages, handle negative current</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>drM</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Added initial support for the SPC200R Speedo meter. Speed will correctly show. Further support pending.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Lenz XPressNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Correct behavior of the ONESENSOR and TWOSENSOR turnout feedback mode. 
                    The turnout's KnownState is set after turnout feedback is received. 
                    In Layout Editor - Entry Exit - Full Interlocking - Signal mast sets the aspect Clear 
                    only after all turnouts are correctly positioned.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>LocoNet Monitor and Reporters now parse LISSY RFID-7 messages as sent by the Arduino-based GCA51
                  LocoIO 2xRFID board.</li>
                <li>Updated "LocoNet Monitor" to give some detail when the command
                    station reports that a throttle's attempt to control a train's
                    speed/direction or functions was ignored by the command station because
                    the LocoNet "Expanded Slot" is "In-Use" by a different throttle
                    than the one which attempted to control the slot.  Other
                    operations can also cause this message when the requesting throttle
                    is not the throttle which "owns" the slot.  This message
                    (an "<OPC_LONG_ACK>" message) is only sent by
                    command stations that support "Expanded Slot" messaging, and
                    is not used by older Digitrax command stations which do not
                    support "Expanded Slots".</li>
                <li>Updated LocoNet Monitor to show certain current-generation
                    Digitrax command stations as "sourcing" certain LocoNet
                    messages.</li>
                <li>Updated LocoNet Monitor to better decode certain messages.</li>
                <li>Added a Configure LocoIO Modules tool, accessible from the LocoNet menu, that lists all
                  connected LocoIO (LNSV1) boards and allows opening a matching programmer, akin to the LNCV pane.</li>
                <li>DecoderPro OpsMode LNSV1 programming has been refactored to use the new Lnsv1MessageContents class
                  instead of locoio.sendRead/.sendWrite it was still using.</li>
                <li>The LocoIO pane that was deprecated since 4.12 has been removed. The LocoIO configuration
                  documentation is retained under html LocoNet help.</li>
                <li>Added the Digitrax UR90X to the LocoNet Monitor tool and
                    JMRI's Help.</li>
                <li>Added the BDL716 as a "decoder" in the JMRI Roster.  Added 
                    LocoNet Monitor support of some BDL716-related messages.</li>
                <li>Improved the CV configuration mechanism for Digitrax 
                    7th-generation Accessory devices.</li>
                <li>Updated several Digitrax help pages to include
                recently introduced products, fix typos.</li>
                <li>The FollowSE*c.py script was broken at some unknown point in the past.
                    The script is updated in this release to fix that.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Marklin CS2</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Added simulated CS2 Connection</li>
                <li>Added support for TCP (in addition to UDP) connections to the CS2.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>NCE</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fix to the Consist Backup/Restore program. All versions from 5.7.1 to5.11.3
                create a backup file including command station memory space beyond the consist tables.
                The bigger issue is that the restore does not check that the addresses in the backup file
                are within the consist tables. Restoring one of those backup files could corrupt the
                memory used for AIU status and RS-232 buffers. This fixes both of those and makes sure the
                restore will only restore within the consist tables.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>There's a new LccPro JMRI application that's 
                    targeted at making it easier to understand and 
                    configure an LCC network.  See the
                    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/gui3/lccpro/LccPro.shtml">help page</a>
                    for more information.</li>
                <li>The 
                    <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/eventtable/EventTablePane.shtml">Event Table</a> 
                    has been improved:<ul>
                    <li>It now shows event ranges.
                    <li>It now automatically shows the names of event IDs that are
                        defined in the LCC Standards if you haven't given them another name.
                    <li>There's now a "Find Name" that searches for any cell in the name columns 
                        containing a particular string.
                    <li>The Find Event and Find Name search boxes update the search
                        as you type.
                    <li>The 
                        <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/eventtable/EventTablePane.shtml#menu">File menu</a> 
                        now contains a "Read from CSV..." item that lets you load event names
                        from a comma-separated (CSV) file.
                </ul></li>
                <li>A graphics issue on Linux in the configuration screens was fixed.
                <li>Improved the Traffic Monitor display:  <ul>
                    <li>Now shows addressed message destinations; 
                    <li>Better alignment of messages on the screen;
                    <li>Improved how event ID names and uses are displayed on event messages.
                    <li>Improved 
                        <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/monitor/MonitorPane.shtml">help page</a>.
                    </ul></li>
                <li>Sensors connected via a bridge can now be accessed via a "Snnn" 
                    hardware address, similar to the "Tnnn" address used for Turnouts.
                <li>You can now enter event IDs by name, in addition to by number:
                    <ul>
                    <li>When adding Turnouts/Sensors/Lights and setting aspect events
                        for OpenLCB Signal Masts
                    <li>When configuring a node using its CDI
                    </ul>
                    When a name has been entered, a tooltip will show the underlying
                    numeric events.
                <li>
                <li>Fixed a bug in the LccPro search function on large LCC networks.</li>
                <li>Added "Node Groups" to LccPro and the Event Table.</li>
                <li>You can now create an LCC/OpenLCB
                    <a href="help/en/html/hardware/openlcb/index.shtml#stringios">StringIO</a>
                    that's shared across multiple JMRI instances on the same LCC/OpenLCB network.
                    If you change the StringIO value in one JMRI instance, it will be propagated to the 
                    other ones over the network. You can then use LogixNG or scripts to 
                    use that information to communicate between JMRI instances.
                <li>Added "Restart" and "Clear CDI cache" to the Send Frame developer screen</li>
                <li>Added "Restart" and "Clear CDI cache" to the contextual (popup) menu in LccPro</li>
                <li>Converged on "Restart" terminology; references to "Reboot" have been changed</li>
                <li>Added overwrite mode to EventID-entry fields. This accessed by using the "insert" key, which 
                    changes the cursor to an underline so you know you're in the mode.  Mac keyboards do not
                    support an insert key, so this feature is not available on the Mac.</li>
                <li>Updated the OpenLCB library being used to version 0.8.5</li>
                <li>Improved handling of memory service timeouts, including
                    variable timeout lengths defined by the datagram responses.
                <li> Made sure that MTT style turnout addressing used the 
                    standard-compliant "linear" form.
                <li>Improved how Event with Payload messages are displayed in the monitor.</li>
                <li>Enabled the Abort button in the Update Firmware window.</li>
                <li>Backup files are now written with dotted-hex event ID values,
                    whether or not an event name is available.  This makes them more reliable
                    and more portable.</li>
                <li>Update the STL Editor to support "event names".
                    <ul>
                      <li>When available, event names will be displayed in the IQYZ tables.</li>
                      <li>The load from backup process will handle event names in older CDI backups.
                      If the event name is no longer in the name store, a temporary event id will
                      be created.</li>
                      <li>Existing event names can be entered in the event columns of the IQYZ tables.
                      Creating new event names is NOT supported.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Correctly decode events-with-payload</li>

                <li>Add sensor events to the event-entry field popup menu</li>
                <li>There's a new storage method for event names.
                    Previously, these were stored in the IdTag table, which might
                    be confusing.
                    Starting with this release, they're separately stored
                    in an eventnames/eventNames.xml file within the user files
                    location.
                    Names that were previously stored in the IdTag table
                    will be automatically migrated to this new method.</li>
                <li>Added a power manager (which activates e.g. the power control)
                    for use with LCC command stations<>/li>

                <li>A new method was added to receive RFID messages as IdTags over LocoNet, for example using the
                  Arduino-based GCA51 LocoIO 2xRFID board.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>SRCP</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fast-clock TIME commands now use the 00-23 format for
                    the hour value and do not repeat 01-12 in the afternoon.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Control Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="CPE" name="CPE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to set signal mast aspects in <em>view</em> mode is controlled by
            the <strong>Disabled</strong> setting for the signal mast icon.  When enabled, changing
            the aspect by clicking or selecting from the aspect list is blocked.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>DecoderPro</h3>
        <a id="DecoderPro" name="DecoderPro"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>You can now choose how to sort the 
                Roster Group Table.</li>
            <li>Hornby TXS Sound Decoders use CVs 200 and 201 to identify the specific Sound Profiles Uploaded to the Chip. 
                Previously the product-id verification process used CV47, 48 and 49 for these decoders. 
                Those CVs contain firmware update information which is not useful when creating conditional decoder definitions for TXS chips. 
                The product-id verification process has been modified to interrogate CVs 201 and 200 for Hornby TXS decoders.
                (This should have no effect on identification for Hornby TTS decoders.)
             </li>
          <li>Added DecoderIndexFile access to a decoder definition's
            &lt;programming&gt;&lt;mode&gt;, allowing a check of supported modes from a DecoderFile using
            <code>getProgrammingModes()</code></li>
          <li>DecoderPro OpsMode LNSV1 programming has been refactored to use the new Lnsv1MessageContents class
            instead of locoio.sendRead/.sendWrite it was still using.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Dispatcher</h3>
        <a id="Dispatcher" name="Dispatcher"></a>
        <ul>
             <li>Provide more information when selecting traininfo file.</li>
             <li>Add the ability to use an AdHoc transit, which is created dynamically between 2 blocks
             Dynamic Transits are always run "No Signals". Dynamic Transits are  removed at train termination. If
             they are not removed for any reason they will not be saved. Currently the route must be clear from end to end
             and any flaws in the routing table will cause grief. Avoid having the train stop in them.</li>
             <li>Add Ghost type block. It must have a "not real" sensor, internal is best.
             The sensor should not be manipulated by logix or logixNG or scripts. Auto trains will
             set and clear these sensors automatically, manual run trains simply ignore them.
             They are useful for adding blocks between 2 turnouts where you would normally add a tiny block with the same block
             as one of the turnouts which causes errors in the routing tables. With care they can be used for placing turnouts
             in their own block.</li>
             <li>Fix errors in loading maxlength and Maxspeed</li>
             <li>Clean up AdHoc Transits after use.</li>
             <li>Fix minor bugs in min speed settings.</li>
             <li>When setting up a new train use detection Entire Train, unless overridden by custom defaults.</li>
             <li>Always check allocation and switch settings before any signaling system.</li>
             <li>Correctly identify and handle changing position of DoubleXOver switch to prevent switch
                 changing under a train.</li>
             <li>Identify conflicting routes when checking allocations thru DoubleXOvers with four blocks.
                 DoubleXOvers with less than four blocks require no additional checks.</li>
             <li>When stopping on previous block going unoccupied and speed profile ramping and minimum speed,
                 use a 75% stopping length factor for the ramp.</li>
             <li>When a train has been stopped with a missing signal mast attempt to restart use BlockAllocation.</li>
             <li>When a missing signal mast has been found use BlockAllocation method to stop if next block not allocated.</li>
             <li>Restore TSA data to the correct place.</li>
             <li>When checking for a hold mast do not assume the section join is at the end of a section.</li>
             <li>For AdHoc trains check to see if a transit can be used.</li>
             <li>Fix TSA edit bugs, when over riding from roster update internal dcc address.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Layout Editor</h3>
        <a id="LE" name="LE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added "Highlight cursor position" option to enable drawing of a 
                square around finger/mouse press/drag area. Useful for touchscreens.
            <li>Added a TurnoutCircleTransparency.py script to change the
                color and transparency of Layout Editor turnout circles</li>
            <li>The ability to set signal mast aspects in <em>view</em> mode is controlled by
            the <strong>Disabled</strong> setting for the signal mast icon.  When enabled, changing
            the aspect by clicking or selecting from the aspect list is blocked.</li>
            <li>The right click menu for <strong>Markers</strong> when using Linux has been fixed.</li>
            <li>Fixed editing and rendering issues with Block Contents Icons.  
                No longer need to have a value in the block to edit the Icon.  
                Rotated blocks render correctly.  
                Empty Hidden now works on initial load and after editing the panel</li>
            <li>Fixed deleting of Inline LogixNG's when Layout Panels are deleted</li>

    <h3>LccPro</h3>
        <a id="LccPro" name="LccPro"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>There's a new LccPro JMRI application that's 
            targeted at making it easier to understand and 
            configure an LCC network.  See the
            <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/gui3/lccpro/LccPro.shtml">help page</a>
            for more information.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug in the LccPro search function on large LCC networks.</li>

              returns the current system time in milliseconds and is
              useful if you want to measure how long time it takes for
              JMRI to do a task.</li>
          <li>The <strong>Listen On Beans</strong>,
              <strong>Listen On Beans - Local variable</strong> and
              <strong>Listen On Beans - Table</strong> actions
              can now listen on Audio beans.</li>

              the <strong>For each</strong> action.</li>
          <li>Improved some GUI layouts by adding scroll bars</li>
          <li>The LogixNG action <strong>Send MERG CBUS event</strong> has
              been added. It's available in the category <strong>Merg Cbus</strong>
              if there is a Merg Cbus connection.</li>
          <li>The semicolon has been added as field delimiter for CSV files used to create
          LogixNG Tables.</li>
          <li>Where Used support has been added to the Formula actions and expressions.  This

            <li>The ability to set signal mast aspects in <em>view</em> mode is controlled by
            the <strong>Disabled</strong> setting for the signal mast icon.  When enabled, changing
            the aspect by clicking or selecting from the aspect list is blocked.</li>
            <li>Fixed deleting of Inline LogixNG's when Panels are deleted</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Preferences</h3>
        <a id="Preferences" name="Preferences"></a>

            <li>Update <strong>Messages</strong> details. Describe the option to hide 
                tabs without active messages.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Roster</h3>
        <a id="Roster" name="Roster"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Roster Table - Fixes initial editing of Last Operated date / time values 
                using 1-12hr values instead of 0-23.</li>

                    <li>If value for memory &lt;memory name&gt; is &lt;eq | ne | lt | gt | le | ge&gt; &lt;value&gt;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Signals</h3>
        <a id="Signals" name="Signals"></a>
        <h4>Signal Systems</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The aspect mapping in the Italian FS-1987
                    signal system has been updated.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Throttle</h3>
        <a id="throttle" name="throttle"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Lionel Jeanson added a driver for 
                the <a href="https://www.zuiki.co.jp/product_info/denshadegomascon_black/"> Densha de GO controler</a> 
                USB controller for the USBThrottle Jynstrument</li>

    <h3>Turnouts, Lights, Sensors and other elements</h3>
        <a id="TLae" name="TLae"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>You can now export the contents of a table
                to a CSV file from the File menu.</li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/tools/StringIO.shtml">StringIOs</a>
                are a new type of object within JMRI.  They're a way to exchange informational strings
                with the layout hardware.  Over time, we'll build-out more system connections for these.
            <li>Fixed a bug that was putting the wrong information in
                a Turnout's comment when a SignalHead was created using that Turnout.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Virtual Sound Decoder</h3>
        <a id="VSD" name="VSD"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added checks to prevent errors due to not enough AudioBuffers.</li>
            <li>Added the OpenAL EFX reverb effect to tunnel tracks.
                Can be activated using "Advanced Location Following"
                and a LayoutEditor panel with a TrackSegment decorated as Tunnel.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Warrants</h3>
        <a id="Wt" name="Wt"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>SCWarrants brought back to life with a few fixes:  
	        <ul>
                <li>It is once again possible to create SCWarrants.</li>
		        <li>Train tracking is now working.</li>
		        <li>Opening the edit dialog for an SCWarrant now shows the correct warrant type.</li>
				<li>Starting an SCWarrants with an un-occupied starting block once agin works as it should, i.e. it is delyed until the starting block become occupied.</li>
		    </ul>
        </ul>

   <h3>Web Server</h3>
        <a id="server" name="server"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a new "web/idtags_examples" directory with an example
                of icons which move to different places on the webpage depending on their most recent report. 
                The example shows cars being switched in a simple yard. 
                The principles shown could be used to show locomotives or train movements.
                See the included PDF file for more information.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Z21 Server</h3>
        <a id="Z21" name="Z21"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Add support for Roco WlanMaus</li>
            <li>Improve UI to show connected clients</li>
            <li>Add UI for mapping of Z21 turnout numbers to JMRI turnouts, routes etc.</li>
            <li>Add help page</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Test Infrastructure</h3>
        <a id="Test" name="Testing"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>JUnitAppender - <code>assertNoErrorMessage</code> and <code>assertMessage(String msg)</code>
                functionality updated to match JavaDoc.</li>
            <li>JUnitAppender - Updated JavaDoc.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>You can now export the contents of a table
                to a CSV file from the File menu.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug in the XSLT transforms used to make 
                panel files human-readable: "if" was used when "when" was required.</li>
            <li>Added a <code>jmri.util.swing.OvertypeTextArea</code> class
                for data entry with overwrite mode, controlled by the insert key.
                (Mac keyboards don't support an insert key, so this is not available on them.)</li>
            <li>The pop-up menu in the various Tables now has an entry
                for "Copy System Name".</li>
            <li>Bug fix: Add new editor panel to the Editor Manager when doing a CPE/PE switch.</li>
            <li>There's a new "DarkLAF HC" dark-mode setting for the display.
                To use it, select Settings then Display, then click the
                button for "DarkLAF HC". Save preferences and restart.  Note that this
                puts a dark background with light text on all JMRI windows.
                You may have to rework your panels for them to look good
                in this mode. Some parts of the interface may be hard to read.</li>
            <li>The PlantUML library we use for various documentation images
                has been updated to the current 1.2025.2 version.</li>
            <li>There is a new <strong>Load and store</strong> pane in Preferences,
                that has options to exclude dynamic content in the tables and
                panels file. Without those dynamic contents, it will be much
                easier to keep JMRI's XML files in a version control system
                (e.g. GitHub) without having un-necessary merge conflicts.</li>
        </ul>
