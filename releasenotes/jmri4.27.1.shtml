<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.20, please follow these instructions carefully:
<!-- Note:  At this point, we're not requiring an update to 4.22; change if needed-->
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later relese.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>New problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None yet</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either
wait for
<a href="jmri4.25.9.shtml">JMRI 4.25.9</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>
 -->

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        Example scripts related to MQTT moved from jython directory to jython\MQTT directory.  This will require
        an update to any start-up actions that reference their location.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.20.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.20 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.21 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>
installing this test release.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21.4.shtml">JMRI 4.21.4</a></span>
        If you use a Safari browser on macOS X, the local
        help system might not work.  There are two
        workarounds:
        <ol>
        <li>If your computer is connected to the internet, use
            the web-based help.  Go to JMRI Preferences, then
            select Help on the left, then click "Open help pages online";
            save and restart
        <li>To get local access, you can select Safari's Preferences,
            then the Advanced pane, then checkmark "Show Develop menu in menu bar"
            </ol>
        If you're using another browser, like Chrome or Firefox, you
        shouldn't encounter this issue.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21.1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo class has become a jmri.SystemConnectionMemo
        interface and a jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo class. This may
        require changes to scripts.  If you have a script that references
        jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemo, please change it to either
        jmri.SystemConnectionMemo or jmri.jmrix.DefaultSystemConnectionMemo
        (it's easier to have you just try the two than to explain which
        one will work in which case)
    </li>

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.21.1.shtml">JMRI 4.21.1</a></span>
        The way preferences are loaded at startup has been slightly
        modified.  There is no impact to JMRI applications, but Non-JMRI
        applications that are not derived from apps.Apps or apps.AppsBase
        but are using jmri.implementation.JmriConfigurationManager to load
        preferences will no longer see preferences if an error occurs.  To
        restore the old behavior, use apps.AppsConfigurationManager instead.
    </li>

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.11.4.shtml">JMRI 4.11.4</a></span>
        There are issues with the Pi-SPROG One command station operation. A number of workarounds should be applied:
        <ul>
            <li>Do not turn on the track power until the power supply to the Pi-SPROG ONE is turned on</li>
            <li>Do not enable extra debugging through default.lcf, nor open the system console window</li>
            <li>Do not open the SPROG console window</li>
            <li>Disable power conversion (CV 29) in all locos</li>
            <li>If connecting via VNC (or similar), setup the screen layout before turning on the track power</li>
        </ul>
        Pi-SPROG One with version 2.4 or earlier firmware will cause a timeout after a track short circuit. A dialog box will
        open to inform the user of this. The track power will be turned off and must be turned on again using the power control.
    </li>
</ul>

        <h4>RFID</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated: Tags are recorded in a table.
                    If there is a Car (from OperationsPro) associated with this tag,
                    the Road name and Car number are shown. The location and Track are
                    shown in ComboBoxes which the user can set
                    and then click on a button to set to the new Location and Track.
                    Another button shows the Car in the Edit Car window.
                    If there is no associated car, a button opens a window with a list of Road names.
                    The user can select a road name and the second list shows all car numbers for that road.
                    Once a car number has been selected a button sets the tag in that Car.
                    By default the only visible road names and numbers are for cars that do not have a tag.
                    A checkbox shows all cars, including those with tags.
                <p>
                    The window is opened from the "RFID" menu choice (there is one for each RFID connection).
                    The first choice opens the standard Serial Monitor Pane.
                    This new Pane is opened from the second choice.
                    The help screen can be viewed from the monitor pane,
                    or via a link in the Hardware RFID connection frame.</li>

          It now also has the child sockets <i>Function</i>
          and <i>FunctionOnOff</i>. These are optional.
          If both are connected, the Throttle action sets
          or resets this function. The child <i>Function</i>
          tells the function number and the child
          <i>FunctionOnOff</i> tells if the function should
          be On (True) or Off (False).</li>
          <li>A single Logix can be imported to LogixNG. See

        </ul>

    <h3>Control Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="CPE" name="CPE"></a>
        <ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Example scripts related to MQTT moved from jython directory to jython\MQTT directory.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Signals</h3>
        <a id="Signals" name="Signals"></a>
        <h4>Signal Systems</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow user-modified signal systems to provide
                    their own copy of an existing aspects.xml file.</li>
            </ul>

   <h3>Switchboard Editor</h3>
        <a id="SW" name="SW"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The menu options to label a switch were enhanced to allow hiding the system name in case a user
              name is configured. This was suggested by Phil-Klein.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Restored tab and shift+tab shortcuts to browse through throttles inner windows</li>
            <li>Address Panel is now focused as a default when opening a new throttle</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Warrants</h3>
        <a id="Wt" name="Wt"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Additional bug fixing and enhancements to Shared Warrants. SWs are
                useful to animate the simultaneous operation of multiple trains.
                Be aware that SWs may mutually block movement that can only be resolved
                by aborting at least one of them. Regular warrants avoid such deadlocks
                due to the priority of their launch times.
                <ul>
               <li>SWs will not allocate any blocks beyond or at a "hazard" (occupation
                 by foreign train, passage beyond a stop signal, conflict with another
                 warrant)</li>
               <li>If a ramp down to stop at a "hazard" stops before entering the next block,
                   the restart is done automatically when the condition clears.
                   </li>
               <li>If a ramp down to stop at a "hazard" overruns into the next block, the
                   SW will allocate the next block if that is permissible. Whether or not, i.e.
                   the position of the train is marked yellow or blue, use the normal Control
                   commands to restart. "Resume" if the "hazard" was occupation or a warrant,
                   or wait for the signal change to an allowable speed.
                   </li>
                 </ul>
            <li>The messages to the status field of the warrant Table and other information
                can be displayed to the console by clicking the "Trace Warrants" button in
                Warrant Preferences.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>WiThrottle Server</h3>
        <a id="WS" name="WS"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a "TelnetTrain.py" example to run a train from the Python command line.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Web Server</h3>
        <a id="server" name="server"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Support for display and interaction with (Control) Panel slipTurnoutIcons has been added
            to JMRI Web Server Panels.<br>
            This includes double and single slips, three-way turnouts and scissors with 2 or 4 turnouts.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Developers: The
                <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Patterns.shtml#typescript">Typescript and Javascript support</a>
                has been updated.</li>
