      Release Notes for JMRI 4.7.1 release
      </h2>

    <p>Date: mmm dd, 2017</p>
    <p>From: (pumpkin)</p>
    <p>Subject: Test version 4.7.1 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in the next JMRI production release around the middle of 2017.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<ul>
<li>None at release time</li>
</ul>

<!--
If any of those effect you, please either wait for
<a href="jmri4.5.9.shtml">JMRI 4.5.9</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">development build installer</a>
from
<a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>JMRI no longer supports the portable paths <pre>resource:</pre> or <pre>file:</pre> that
        were deprecated in JMRI 2.13. When loading a panel, an error message will be displayed
        if the panel contains a path that starts with <pre>resource:</pre> and the panel will
        not load until changed using an external editor. Paths starting with <pre>file:</pre>
        cannot be automatically flagged because JMRI allows file: URLs.</li>
    <li>JMRI applications will not load a panel file that fails XML validation; an error will be
        shown that explains the error, allowing it to be fixed using an editor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.6.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.6 release note</a> for warnings predating the 4.6 development series.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.6)</em> 
        As part of fixing the 
        <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/2081">TMCC throttle issue</a>,
        the handling of TMCC preferences was changed.  If you have a TMCC
        connection configured, please go to the 
        "<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#Connection">Defaults</a>"
        pane in the Preferences window and make sure that the 
        TMCC connection is selected for the appropriate device types.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.2)</em>This and future versions of JMRI may not function on OS X if the Java SE 6 provided by Apple is installed. OS X
    operating system updates routinely remove this version of Java SE 6. Please raise any issues concerning this on the
    user's group.
    <p>To remove Java SE 6 from OS X, follow these steps (these steps assume
      JMRI is installed in the folder <em>/Applications/JMRI</em>, if not,
      adjust the following paths as needed):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <em>Terminal.app</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Reboot into Recovery Mode by restarting your
          Mac and pressing Cmd-R until the Apple logo appears. Once in Recovery Mode,
          select Terminal from the Utilities menu.</p>
        </li>
      <li>Run the command <code>/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh</code> It can take
        up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.
        <p><em>El Capitan only:</em> Run the command <code>bash /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Applications/JMRI/PanelPro.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall-java6.sh /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD</code>
          It can take up to a half hour to complete. Wait for the message <em>Removed Apple Java SE6</em>.</p>
        </li>
      <li><em>El Capitan only:</em> Restart your Mac.</li>
    </ol>
  
<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.2)</em>Support for directly executing AppleScript within JMRI has been removed
    due to changes in macOS and Java outside our control. If you require the
    ability to use AppleScript, you may be able to add this capability on your
    own by visiting <a href="https://jmri.github.io/applescript">JMRI
      AppleScript Support</a>, but please be aware that this may not work
    on upcoming releases of macOS or Java.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.5.1)</em>Internal turnouts and sensors need to have complete, individual system names.
    The names "IT" and "IS" (without any suffix) are no longer permitted:
    "IT12" is fine, but just "IT" is not. Most panel files that contain these should
    automatically migrate them to new names when saved, but in some cases you might need to manually update them.

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.3.3)</em> You can now set the order of your startup items: If you're opening panel files, running scripts, etc as
    the program starts up, there's a preferences pane that lets you easily set the order in which those happen.
    If you've set the order manually (e.g. by editing configuration files) in the past, please check this
    preference to make sure it's set the way you want.</p>

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.1.2)</em> Jython has been upgraded to version 2.7.0 with the following potentially breaking changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The decodeJmriFilename() function is no longer available by default. Use the  FileUtil.getExternalFilename() method instead.</li>
      <li>The simple propertyListener object is no longer available by default. Create your own, following the examples provided in the jython folder in the JMRI distribution.</li>
      <li>jmri_defaults.py included in the JMRI distribution is no longer executed by default, but will be executed before any other Jython scipts if included in your User Files location.</li>
      <li>The default behavior of python.cachedir.skip is now true. If using a custom python.properties file, include "python.cachedir.skip=false" in that file.</li>
      <li>Certain Python scripts are too large to be evaluated in Jython. If a script fails with the <code>java.io.IOException: Mark invalid</code> error, set "jython.exec=true" in a custom python.properties file or rewrite the script to be less than 100,000 characters per file. Note that when using "jython.exec=true" it may be desirable to run the included script jmri_bindings.py as a startup action to emulate the evaluation environment used when jython.exec=false.</li>
    </ul>

<p><em>(Since JMRI 4.1.1)</em> Decoder definitions that use the "ivariable" form are now deprecated.  Definitions
    included with this release have been converted to the new form.
    If you have decoder definitions with the older "ivariable" form, they will no longer
    validate, but can still be used for the first couple of test releases in this series.
    Please ask on the
    <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/info">JMRI users Yahoo group</a>
    for help converting them, or just drop them and use the current definitions.</p>

   <h4>Dispatcher</h4>
        <ul>
             <li>Modify auto allocation operation of Dispatcher to allow via a selection made when creating a train 
             that will override the default practice of allocating no more than three sections in front of the train. 
             The override allows Dispatcher to allocate all the way to the designated end 
             block barring other criteria such as occupation. (Jason Janzen)</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Layout Editor</h4>
        <ul>

                Translators, please review your language.</li>
                <li>The function of Turnouts in use as outputs for a Signal Head are now stored as localized Comments in the Turnout table.<br>
                Existing comments are retained until they are manually deleted, after which a change in outputs will be stored.</li>
                <li>After adding a new Head, the Name fields on the pane are emptied to help prevent using the same name again and receiving an error.</li>
                <li>Adding a Bachmann Acela Signal Head now requires an active system connection to guarantee the proper ID.</li>
                <li>The intention of the Home/Distant choice for a MERG head is explained in a clearer label and the items to choose from are adaptable per language.</li>
            </ul>

        <h5>Signal Masts</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Per user request, the Output Matrix Signal Mast connection can be configured using up to 6 outputs instead of 5.</li>
            </ul>
        
   <h4>Warrants</h4>

   <h4>Internationalization</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Expanded translations in Catalan, Danish and German for many of the tools.</li>
            <li>Starting JMRI after changing Locale (language) gives a more informative warning in the Console.</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>For those connections which have the ability to monitor the bus traffic, the
			feature to save the monitor data to a file has been improved.  If the tool is 
			unable to access the log file, a dialog box will appear to inform the user of 
			the problem.  Monitor log files will default to be placed in the configuration 
			profile directory, where in some cases, previous versions of JMRI could attempt 
			place the log file in the program directory.  As before, the user may select
			a directory other than the configuration profile directory for storing the
			log file.  This improvement affects the monitoring tools for many connection 
			types.</li>
            <li>JMRI applications will not load a panel file that fails XML validation; an error will be
                shown that explains the error, allowing it to be fixed using an editor.
                (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/2719">#2719</a>)</li>
	        <li>JMRI no longer supports the portable paths <pre>resource:</pre> or <pre>file:</pre> that
	        were deprecated in JMRI 2.13. When loading a panel, an error message will be displayed
                if the panel contains a path that starts with <pre>resource:</pre> and the panel will
                not load until changed using an external editor. Paths starting with <pre>file:</pre>
                cannot be automatically flagged because JMRI allows file: URLs.
                (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/2719">#2719</a>)</li>
    	    <li>If a connection fails to initialize correctly, startup actions will not be run. An error
	        message will be displayed reading "Unable to run startup actions due to earlier failures."
                (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/2799">#2799</a>)</li>
            <li>The WiThrottle window can now be resized so that when several client devices are
                connected, it's possible to adjust the list to see all of them without needing to scroll
                (<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/2857">#2857</a>)</li>
            <li>Added some additional tools for decoding and displaying NMRA DCC packets to the
                NmraPacket class.</li>
            <li>Added 
                <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/XmlPersistance.shtml">support for reading older panel files</a> 
                that use deprecated conversion classes</li>
            <li>Behind the scenes, a lot of error handling and code documentation was added.</li>
        </ul>
