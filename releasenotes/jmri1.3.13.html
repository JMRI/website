      Release Notes for JMRI 1.3.13 developer release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: April 3, 2004</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 1.3.13 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for
      download.</p>

        <h3>Notes:</h3>
	<ul>

	<li>This is a test release.</li>
	<li>Please post a note if you encounter any
	new or old bugs!</li>
	<li>Please back up your JMRI files before
	installing this, in case you want to go back to an earlier
	version.</li>

	<li> This test version was created to check a change to the Lenz
	XpressNet handling of hardware flow control.  If you're a Lenz user, we
	would greatly appreciate it if you could use this version and let us
	know if it's OK.
	</li>

	<li>Although there are many important items on the to-do lists, we also 
	need a new production version.  Please test this version thoroughly, 
	and post your results.  Unless new critical problems are found, this 
	will become the production version on April 6th, 2004.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>New warnings:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li> None.
	</ul>

	<h3>Older warnings for the 1.3 series of test versions:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Panel files written by 1.3.11 and later versions may not be readable 
	with versions before 1.3.0.  Older files will remain readable, but if 
	you edit them with this version and then store them, you might not be 
	able to read them if you go back to version 1.2.5.</li>

	<li>There is no OS/2 version of this test release because our OS/2
	test machine is no longer online.  If you have a suitable OS/2
	machine and are willing to host our release testing, please let me
	know.</li>

	<li>If you are building your own copy of the program from the source
	code using Ant, please make sure to update the build.xml file.
	There have been some changes in the build procedure during the
	1.3.9 build.</li>

	<li>These downloads are significantly larger than version 1.3.5 and
	previous.  This is due to the addition of a help system starting in
	test version 1.3.8.</li>

	<li>LocoNet sensor numbering has been changed starting in version
	1.3.4!  This will effect people who have panel files (.xml files
	containing panel definition) for LocoNet block occupancy sensors.
	The sensor numbers now start with 1, not 0, so you'll have to edit
	the panel files to change e.g. LS0 to LS1, LS23 to LS24, etc.  This
	does not effect input via other (non-LocoNet) protocols, including
	C/MRI, NCE AIU, etc.  If you use LocoNet sensor numbers for the
	Speedometer, you'll have to increase them by one also.</li>

	<li>If you have pre-1.2.3 roster entries that use Zimo decoder
	definitions, you'll have to recreate them.  The Zimo decoder
	definitions have been completely reworked in a better organization
	starting with test version 1.2.3.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Changes since test version 1.3.12:</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>Paul Bender changed the handling of flow control on an XPressNet
		port when hardware flow control is disabled.
	</ul>

    <h3>Download links:</h3>
