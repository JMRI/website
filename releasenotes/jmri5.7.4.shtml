      Release Notes for JMRI 5.7.4 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: Feburary 9, 2024</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.7.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of 5.7.* test releases.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.8 production release in June 2024.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<!--
<P>We are getting close to the next production release, so we would particularly
appreciate your testing of this release to make sure it works for you. That way,
if you find new problems, we can try to fix them before the production release.</P>
 -->

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.
We would appreciate your feedback on it.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri5.6.shtml#warnings">JMRI 5.6 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 5.7 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to at least <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>
before installing this test release.
See <a href="#update">instructions above</a>.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and

    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.3.shtml">JMRI 5.5.3</a></span>
        Scripts that output Logging statements with log4jv1.x ( org.apache.log4j ) imports will stop working 
        from JMRI 5.5.4 and should be updated to use SLF4J logging.
        <br>See <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/12237/files">here</a> for some examples on how to do this.</li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.4.shtml">JMRI 5.5.4</a></span>
        Custom default.lcf Logging Control Files will cease to take effect from JMRI 5.5.4
        <br>To create a custom default_lcf.xml in the new Logging Configuration format, see 
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/Debug.shtml">JMRI Debugging and Logging</a>
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.5.shtml">JMRI 5.5.5</a></span>
        XML files with table contents and panels have been changed in JMRI 5.5.5. It's therefore not
        possible to load an xml file with tables and panels that has been created with JMRI 5.5.5 or
        later with a JMRI version pre 5.5.5.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.5.shtml">JMRI 5.5.5</a></span>
        MQTT Connection - Throttle loco address and function placeholders in MQTT topics have changed from
        $address and $function to {0} and {1} for consistency with other objects.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.7.1.shtml">JMRI 5.7.1</a></span>
        Several systems have had extensive updates to their serial
        support.  If you have trouble connecting to your layout hardware
        after installing this version, please contact us
        <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">on the JMRIusers list</a>

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri5.7.3.shtml">Test Release 5.7.3</a>:</h2>

The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=milestone%3A5.7.4+is%3Amerged">list of included changes</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.


    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Several tools have improved layout when the
                    screen size is reduced.</li>
                <li>LocoNet Monitor has improved reporting of "Query Mode" 
                    messages.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>MQTT</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed missing topic unsubscribes when deleting turnouts, sensors, etc</li>
                <li>Fixed missing topic unsubscribe on throttle release for cab functions</li>
                <li>Added code to properly dispose of MQTT components</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>

        <h4>MRC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>MRC serial connections should use odd parity.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated script DisplayTrackCircuit.py to support the Tower +Que node
                    <p>This script populates a set of events to match the traffic circuit and then
                    creates a listener for them. That listener populates and maintains a memory to
                    show text for the state of the traffic circuit.</li>
                <li>Several tools have improved layout when the
                    screen size is reduced.</li>
                <li>Added an "ID Tool". This will cause the transmit LED on one
                    physical node to flash.  This can be a convenient way to identify which 
                    physical node underneath the layout is the one you're working with in JMRI, 
                    e.g. when you need to move a wire.
                <li>Configuration of large String fields now has an improved interface:
                    You can see how many characters remain in the large field and word
                    breaks are now respected.
                <li>The Event Table now has buttons to copy Sensor and Turnout user names
                    into the relevant Event ID names. These only fill in blank Event ID
                    names, they don't overwrite any names you might have already entered.
                <li>Fixed a bug in the event table that could cause duplicate event listings.
            </ul>


    <h3>New / Updated decoder definitions</h3>

        <h4>MD Electronics</h4>
             <ul>
                <li>New definition for the mXion DRIVE-L decoder.</li>
             </ul>

        <h4>PIKO</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Add CVs for PMW modulations, add tooltips</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>SoundTraxx</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Genesis OEM add new models</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Uhlenbrock</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Add CVs for PMW modulations, add tooltips</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Warning</strong><br>
              The type <strong>Boolean</strong> has been added to 5.7.4
              for global and local variables. But due to a bug, this
              doesn't work. It will be fixed in 5.7.5.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>Table: For each</strong> can now loop
              thru the headers too. If indirect addressing is used for
              the row or column name, use the empty string to get the
              headers.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>Table</strong> is added. It  lets the
              user set the value of a cell in a LogixNG table.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>Request update of sensor</strong> is
              added. It requests that the state of a sensor is updated
              from the layout, if possible. Not all connections supports
              this, for example LocoNet.</li>
          <li>LogixNG has two new preferences which are disabled by default:
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Use strict typing of global variables</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Use strict typing of local variables</strong></li>
              </ul>
              If strict typing is enabled, local and global variables
              that are initialized to a string, integer or floating number
              cannot be set to a value of another type. LogixNG will try
              to convert the new value to the desired type, for example
              a local variable of type floating number will be assigned
              the value 12.0 if it's assigned 12 and it will be assigned
              the value 32. if it's assigned the string "32.5".
              <br>
              Local and global variables that are initialized to another
              type, for example array, map or LogixNG table can't be
              assigned a new value.
              <br>
              If you want to use strict typing but still want to override
              this setting for a particular local or global variable, then
              initialize this variable to <strict>None</strict>. Variables
              that are initialized to <strict>None</strict> will not have
              strict typing,
          </li>
          <li>A new preference is added that selects if the
              <strong>If Then Else</strong> action should have
              <strong>Execute on change</strong> or
              <strong>Always execute</strong> as the default.
          </li>
          <li>The expression <strong>Sensor Edge</strong> no longer
              supports indirect addressing of the sensor. It has never
              really worked since Sensor Edge needs to listen on the
              sensor and it cannot listen on a sensor if indirect
              addressing is used.<br>
              If a panel is loaded and a Sensor Edge expression uses
              indirect addressing, an error message is added to the
              log:<br>
              <strong>Error during loading Sensor Edge expression
              IQDE:AUTO:0003 due to: Addressing must be Direct</strong><br>
              where IQDE:AUTO:0003 is the system name of the expression.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>Window to front</strong> as been added.
              It brings a window to the front and can be used if you for
              example want to have an icon on a panel that moves focus to
              another window.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>Decode JSON</strong> is added. It decodes
              a JSON string in a local variable to a JsonNode tree and
              puts it in another local variable.</li>
          <li>LogixNG formula now supports JSON as well. It's in particular
              useful together with the action <strong>Decode JSON</strong>.
              A JSON dataset can be indexed as a map or as an array, for
              example by <strong>MyJson{"decoder}{"model"}[4]</strong>.
              The result is a Json text node, so use the <strong>str()</strong>
              function to convert the value to a string afterwards.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Resources</h3>
        <a id="Resources" name="Resources"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a blue medium LED.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Routes</h3>
        <a id="Routes" name="Routes"></a>
       <ul>
            <li>You can now specify where the control turnout should have its
                known state (the default old behavior) or its commanded state
                checked to see if the route should be set.  This can be useful
                e.g. if you have feedback set on the turnout and want to react
                quickly to a commanded change.</li>
       </ul>

    <h3>Signals</h3>
        <a id="Signals" name="Signals"></a>

        <h4>Signal Masts</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed bug where no dialogue would display when Discovering Signalling Mast Pairs and Layout Block Routing is not enabled.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Cab Signals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial support for creating <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/etcs/index.shtml">ERTMS / ETCS Driver Interfaces</a></li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Turnouts, Lights, Sensors and other elements</h3>
        <a id="TLae" name="TLae"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug where deleting the last (highest-numbered) Turnout
                would throw an exception.</li>
            <li>Fixed a Turnout Table bug where an incorrect border may display in Turnout Feedback.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The JOAL library has been updated to run natively on Windows and Linux machines.</li>
        </ul>
