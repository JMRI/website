      Release Notes for JMRI 5.9.5 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: October 11, 2024</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.9.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.9.* test releases.
It requires at least Java 11 to work.
We recommend that you use Java 17.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI  production release in December 2024.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<!--
<P>We are getting close to the next production release, so we would particularly
appreciate your testing of this release to make sure it works for you. That way,
if you find new problems, we can try to fix them before the production release.</P>
 -->

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.
We would appreciate your feedback on it.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.

    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>

                <li>Fix a problem when CDI contains "immediate" slider hints</li>
                <li>Slider hints now control tick spacing, instead of number of ticks.</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>

   <h3>Dispatcher</h3>
        <a id="Dispatcher" name="Dispatcher"></a>
        <ul>
             <li>Do not release any allocated section from a train if the position of the train is not known.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Layout Editor</h3>
        <a id="LE" name="LE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved zoom menu selection matching.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>A bug is fixed in the <strong>Timer</strong> action. The
              bug caused the timer to <strong>not</strong> start
              automatically when the tables and panel file is loaded,
              despite the <strong>Start timer immediately on load</strong>
              setting was selected for the timer.</li>
          <li>A bug is fixed that caused problem with storing a table
              and panel file if the LogixNG preference
              <strong>Install debugger</strong> is unselected.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>Throttle</strong> now has the option
              <strong>Stop loco then switching loco</strong>. If it's
              selected, the loco is stopped before switching to another
              loco.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>OperationsPro</h3>
        <a id="Operations" name="Operations"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Changed "Wait" to travel time in the route edit window.</li>
            <li>New feature, you can now add or remove locomotives in a train's route.</li>
            <li>HPT (Horse Power per Ton) in the Setting window can now accept decimal numbers.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Permissions</h3>
        <a id="Permissions" name="Permissions"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The permission system has been improved. Users and
                roles remains but the permissions has changed. As a
                result, you might need to set the permissions for each
                role again.</li>
            <li>If you change permissions, you need to restart JMRI for
                the changes to take effect.</li>
            <li>A new permission <strong>Panel permission</strong> is
                added. If the user doesn't have at least <strong>View</strong>
                permission, the panel will be empty with the text
                <strong>Permission denied</strong>.</li>
            <li>The JMRI web server now has support for permissions. The
                user can login and logout using the web server. Note
                that the web server has the guest user <strong>remote guest</strong>
                instead of the usual <strong>guest</strong> user. The
                remote guest user has by defaul the <strong>Remote guest</strong>
                role. This allows you to have different permissions for
                web access than local access for users that have not
                logged in.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Roster</h3>
        <a id="Roster" name="Roster"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>On roster media pane (as well as functions panel), 
                images can be opened by double clicking on the panel or via the contextual menu. 
                Direct images drag'n drop from any aplication is also supported, 
                a png file will be created from the drag'n drop content.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Z21 Server</h3>
        <a id="Z21" name="Z21"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fix an error that causes occasional crashes.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Some cleanup has been done to JMRI. It shouldn't affect
                the users, but if it does, please report it on the
                <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/topics">JMRI Users Groups.io</a>
                Group. If there is any problem, it could case JMRI to
                not quit properly, not restart properly or leave Java
                running when JMRI has quit.</li>
            <li>It's now possible for a class in JMRI to replace the
                serial port on the fly, without the rest of JMRI noticing
                it. It's useful for example for a firmware uploader that
                needs exclusive access to the serial port. For an
                example, see jmri.jmrix.loconet.demoport.DemoSerialPortAction.</li>
        </ul>
