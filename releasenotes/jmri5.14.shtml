      Release Notes for JMRI 5.14 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: MM DD, 2025</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Production Release 5.14 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<p>We are very pleased to announce that the 5.13 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production Release 5.14" available for download today.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<!-- 
If this affects you, please either
wait for
<a href="jmri5.15.1.shtml">JMRI 5.15.1</a>, due out shortly,
or pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">development build installer</a>

<h3>New warnings for this production release:</h3>

<ul>
    <p>None Yet
</ul>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri5.12.shtml#warnings">JMRI 5.12 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 5.13 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>
before installing this release, see above.

<ul>
    <li>If you're using a Firefox web browser and opening JMRI 
        help files locally (not over the web), a Firefox bug
        can sometimes cause it to enter a loop.  There's a 
        workaround in
        <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/message/239205">this JMRIusers post</a>.
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.11.3.shtml">JMRI 5.11.3</a></span>
        There's been a change to how OpenLCB turnouts are
        addressed when using the MTT addressing short cut.
        Turnouts 253,254,255, 510, 511, 512, 765, 766 and 767
        will be addressed differently.  If you're using any of these
        via e.g. MTT253, you will need to change the address.  If you've
        been having trouble getting those addresses to work, this change should
        fix that.
        </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.11.5.shtml">JMRI 5.11.5</a></span>
        OperationsPro program file locations were changed in 
        <a href="jmri5.11.5.shtml">JMRI 5.11.5</a>. Start up actions
        involving operations windows from previous releases no longer work. 
        You'll need to remove them and
        add them back if needed.</li>

    <h3>New / Updated decoder definitions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>No Decoder decoder with extended addressing</strong>
              decoder has been added. This "no decoder" definition allows
              a roster entry to be created that does not have a physical
              decoder of its own.
              <br>
              It was created to suport the Zimo MX series of funcion-only
              decoders that allow TWO addresses to be defined for a single
              decoder - the primary address and a secondary address.
              Function operations will result from commands sent to EITHER
              decoder address.
              <br>
              The initial "No Decoder" definition is limited to a primary
              address of 1-127, this extended version allows the full
              range of extended addresses to be used</li>
          <li>"DCCWorld.com" has been added as a manufacturer ID that DecoderPro
              recognizes.</li>
        </ul>

         <h4>Digitrax</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated Series 7 mobile (locomotive) decoder definitions.</li>
                <li>Added Series 8 mobile (locomotive) decoder definitions.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Public Domain and DIY decoders</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>New definitions for Rokuhan A053 and A059 decoders</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Technologistic (train-O-matic)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fix for Brake function key selection (F0-F28), including "no active" value. (Lokommander II decoders)</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Control Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="CPE" name="CPE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug that would cause Markers to be created in random locations.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>DecoderPro</h3>
        <a id="DecoderPro" name="DecoderPro"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The permissions <strong>On Program Track</strong> and
                <strong>Program On Main</strong> has been added in the
                section <strong>Decoder programming</strong>. If
                permissions are enabled, these needs to be enabled
                for the user to program decoders.</li>
            <li>There are two new columns in the DecoderPro main
                display:  "Decoder Manufacturer" and "Decoder Family".
                These start out hidden.  To display them,
                right or control click in the header of any column,
                and then put a check next to the column name.</li>
            <li>The individual DecoderPro tab panes can now be detached
                and independently positioned on the screen.  To detach
                a pane, click on the "two pages" icon on the tab.
                To reattach, just close the detached window.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where changes to the speed table sliders
                would not remind you if they had not been saved to the
                roster file.</li>
            <li>When working with a single roster entry, there's a 
                new "Comments" page. You can pop that off (using the 
                page icon in the tab) and enter your comments there 
                as you configure the values in the other panes.
                What you type there will appear in the comment field
                on the Roster Entry pane and vice versa.</li>
            <li>Detachable panes no longer appear in the Windows menu
                <i>unless</i> they are actually detached.</li>
            <li>Added Help and Windows menus to the detached panes.</li>
            <li>It's now possible to disable Programming Track and/or
                Programming On Main. See Preferences -> Roster ->
                Programmer.</li>
            <li>DecoderPro now shows a "No Group" choice in the Roster Groups selector.
                This contains all those roster entries that have not been 
                assigned to a specific group.  You can delete roster entries
                from the roster when displaying the "No Group" by selecting
                the roster entry, then ctrl-clicking / right-clicking on it
                and selecting "Delete from Roster".</li>
            <li>Update the roster XML Schema to fix a bug preventing
                validation of the roster.xml file in some circumstances.</li>
            <li>There is now a way to define indexed CVs in a decoder definition so
                that the PI and SI values will be written to new values afterward, 
                e.g. 11.12.123;0.1
            <li>Fixed a problem causing the starting value when doing
                CV reads to erroneously be zero.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Dispatcher</h3>
        <a id="Dispatcher" name="Dispatcher"></a>
        <ul>
             <li>At the end of a PAUSE transit action, set speedby signal, 
                do not blindly restore pre-pause value.</li>
             <li>The RosterSpeedProfile has been corrected to improve calculations for stopping.
                 If you have manually compensated for those errors you may want to re-evaluate
                 the Min/Max throttle settings and stopping distance percentage.</li>
             <li>The F-Numbers for Transit Section Actions for Light, Bell and Horn can be set on a per train basis.</li>
             <li>Fix bug delayed start actions not working when using speed profile ramping</li>
             <li>When creating/editing a transit you may now set the forward and reverse stopping distances
                 for individual sections. The forward and reverse refer to the direction thru the transit not
                 the direction thru the section (this differs from fwd/rev stopping sensors).
                 These are expressed in per cent and are in addition to the adjustment
                 specified when defining a train.</li>
             <li>Fix Create New Transit caused by bad initialization of stopping distance arrays. Fix crash when transit has no sections.</li>
			 <li>Fix TransitAction SetMaxSpeed</li>
             <li>Add RosterGroup selection combo to Activate New Train. Remembers selection across sessions.</li>
             <li>Fix bug ActivateTrain SaveDIalog</li>
			 <li>Correct calculating remaining length of blocks in a section.</li>
            <li>Display minimum scale speed  when activating train.</li>
            <li>Add basic column sorting on the traininfo selection screen, and correct missplaced columns.</li>
            <li>Tidy up debug/trace in RosterSpeedProfile.</li>
            <li>Make info message in allocated section to debug.</li>
            <li>Fix Exception when starting trains under inauspicious circumstances.</li>
            <li>Change the default location for the <em>dispatcheroptions.xml</em> file to the
            <strong>dispatcher</strong> directory.</li>
			<li>Optionally, limit Maximum Speed to any Block occupied by the train.</li>
			<li>Add scroll bars to the Dispatcher Options for the smaller screens</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Layout Editor</h3>
        <a id="LE" name="LE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Normally, Layout Editor turnouts in UNKNOWN state are indicated
                by drawing both legs of the turnout, instead of showing just one
                as for CLOSED and THROWN.  There's a new option 'Show ? When Unknown'
                in the turnout's contextual menu that will make the UNKNOWN state
                more visible.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>NX - Entry/Exit Tool</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed a bug which could sometimes cause extraneous messages
                about failure to create a multipoint route even though one was available.</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug that would cause Markers to be created in random locations.</li>
            <li>A problem with LE track drawing and background images from 5.11.6 thru 5.13.3 including 5.12 has been fixed.
                The problem appears if you have a background image in the Layout Editor. If so, the track disappears behind
                the background image.</li>
            <li>Add two options to override the changes made in PR #13857 - Entry/Exit Enhancements
              <ul>
                <li>Suppress the multi-point failed dialog</li>
                <li>Revert to the old GUI behavior</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>

        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>The class <strong>jmri.jmrit.logixng.Category</strong> has been split into
              <strong>jmri.Category</strong> and <strong>jmri.jmrit.logixng.LogixNG_Category</strong>.</li>
          <li>It's now possible to execute some LogixNG commands when a LogixNG error occurs.
              It's useful if JMRI run without a display and you want a notification for
              example by a sensor. To use it, select menu item
              <strong>Tools -> LogixNG -> Edit error handling module</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Preferences -> LogixNG -> Default error handling</strong>
              has the new option <strong>Abort without error</strong>. If it
              is selected and there is an error in the CondtionalNG, the
              ConditionalNG will be aborted but there will be no logging to the
              system console. This might be useful together with the
              <strong>Error handling module</strong>.</li>
          <li>The category <strong>OperationsPro</strong> and the action
              <strong>Run automation</strong> have been added. The
              <strong>Run automation</strong> lets you run an OperationsPro
              automation from LogixNG.</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug in the action <strong>Program On Main</strong>
              that caused connection specific programming modes to fail.</li>
          <li>The new action <strong>ExecuteProgram</strong> has been
              added. It lets you launch a program from JMRI.</li>
          <li>The new action <strong>Request update of turnout</strong>
              has been added. It's used when you want JMRI to request
              the state of a turnout from the layout. Note that not all
              systems support this.</li>
          <li>The new action <strong>For each with delay</strong> has
              been added. It's similar to <strong>For each</strong> but
              has a delay between each item. It's useful when you need
              to do something for example for every turnout, but where
              you need to wait some time between each action.</li>
        </ul>
