      Release Notes for JMRI 3.9.2 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2014</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.9.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.10 production release around the end of 2014.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>This is the first series of JMRI to support the MRC command stations
via the Prodigy USB computer interface.</b></p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>
<p>RFID support has been changed to allow for additional protocols - existing
   CORE-ID readers <em>should</em> remain unaffected but, in certain
   circumstances, it may be necessary to update connection configuration with 
   the correct protocol.</p>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

<p>None at the time of this release.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.9.1:</h3>

<p>The roster table is now smarter about sorting columns if they contain numbers (instead of alphanumeric names).

<p>ARM V7 processor libraries added, so this architecture should work out-of-the-box on Linux.

<p>The format of the mask value in XML decoder definitions is now included in validity checking. The existing decoder
definitions had a few problems with this, now fixed.

<h4>System Support</h4>
<h5>RFID</h5>
<p>The current implementation has been refactored to better facilitate the support of additional
   protocols. Whilst this <em>should</em> not affect the existing CORE-ID readers, it may be necessary
   to update connection configuration with the correct protocol. (Matthew Harris)</p>
<p>Initial support has been added for RFID readers that use the Olimex protocol.
   Many thanks to George Bowler for testing with real hardware. (Matthew Harris)</p>
<p>Initial support has been added for RFID readers that use the Parallax protocol. (Matthew Harris)</p>

<h5>OpenLCB</h5>
The OpenLCB support has been updated to the most recent version of the specifications.
The most noticeable effect will be faster and cleaner operation of the configuration (CDI-using) tools.


<h4>New / Updated decoder definitions</h4>
<p>There's now an "exists" qualifier for use in decoder definition files.

<p>Alain Le Marchand added Tsunami SoundCar DSD definition</p>

<h4>Scripting</h4>

<p>There's now a decodeJmriFilename(..) helper routine for use in Jython scripts.
See the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/tools/scripting/FAQ.shtml">scripting FAQ</a> for more info.

<p>Fixed some problems in C/MRI-specific sample scripts.
