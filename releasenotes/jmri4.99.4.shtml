      Release Notes for JMRI 4.99.4 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: March 13, 2022</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.99.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 4.99.* test releases to migrate JMRI to Java 11.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.0 production release at the end of Spring 2022.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.24, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/JVMCapabilities.shtml">JVM Capabilities</a> pages.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        A number of classes and methods that have been deprecated for a long time
        are removed in this release.  These include:
        <ul>
            <li>apps.JmriPlugin</li>
            <li>apps/startup/StartupActionFactory</li>
            <li>Routes/Turnouts/Sensors: One form of getNextAddress</li>
            <li>Handling of preferences from before JMRI 4.0; upgrade through JMRI 4.20 instead</li>
            <li>ShutDownTask, AbstractShutDownTask - use call & run methods now</li>
            <li>Removed JythonAutomaton, JythonAutomatonAction, JythonSiglet, JythonSigletAction
                unused classes.  These have been made obsolete by JMRI's native scripting,
                and haven't been used since JMRI 1.2
            </li>
            <li>SSL (BlockBossLogic) - change to start/stop calls</li>
            <li>Various TrafficManagers.instance methods - use InstanceManager</li>
            <li>Throttle.getListeners() - use getPropertyChangeListeners</li>
            <li>Removed obsolete RosterRecorder class;
                function now available via scripting
            </li>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        The PowerManager now only fires events with the id "power".  Before this
        release, it also fired events with the id "Power". Check that
        your scripting code is looking for the right form.
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This version no longer reads ZeroConf IPv4 and IPv6 preferences
        written with JMRI 4.16 and before.  Please make sure to upgrade
        to JMRI 4.20 (or later) and save your preferences before
        updating to this version if you have configured the WiThrottle preference pane.</li>

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri4.99.3.shtml">Test Release 4.99.3</a>:</h2>

The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=milestone%3A4.99.4+is%3Amerged">list of 97 included changes</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.


    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>
        <h4>C/MRI</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Added CmriExample.py,
                    a sample script for directly sending a C/MRI frame.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>KPF-Zeller</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial support for the
                    <a href="https://kpf-zeller.de/kpf/rollenstand/index.php">KPF-Zeller roller speedometer</a>.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Added Digitrax DCS210Plus command station</li>
                <li>A storm of LocoNet messages could result if certain command station models
                    have track power turned off whem JMRI starts. The status enquiry messages would
                    fail, and JMRI would repeat them in an effort to get complete information from the layout.
                    This release no longer retries messages in that case. If you are not getting
                    initial status from some devices on your layout, you should power up
                    your LocoNet system, including track power, before starting JMRI.
                </ul>

        <h4>Uhlenbrock Intellibox</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved handling of the decoder functions.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>New / Updated decoder definitions</h3>

        <h4>ESU</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed a problem introduced in JMRI 4.99.3 that
                prevents the function settings from being properly stored.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>ZIMO</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated some MX640-series definitions, adding menu items for on-track operations.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>DecoderPro</h3>
        <a id="DecoderPro" name="DecoderPro"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>You can now write out just edited CV values to a CSV file.</li>
            <li>The programmer pane "display" element now supports a "viewOnly" attribute.
                For more information see the
                <a href="/help/en/html/apps/DecoderPro/Programmer.shtml" target="_blank">Create a Custom Programmer</a>
                page.

	        <li>Improved XSLT display of all elements.</li>
        </ul>

     <h3>Logix</h3>
        <a id="Logix" name="Logix"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>Change the system name input for the Copy command to use a combo box.  This makes it
          easier to select an existing Logix as the copy destination.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Copy</i> now works in the LogixNG table. With <i>Copy</i>,
          you can copy the entire LogixNG to a new LogixNG with all its ConditionalNGs.</li>
	  <li>Improved XSLT display of all elements.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Panel Editor</h3>

            <li>Added waitSignalMastState, waitSignalHeadState to AbstractAutomat support.</li>
            <li>Added shortcuts for transits and sections.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Signals</h3>
        <a id="Signals" name="Signals"></a>
        <h4>Signal Systems</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>New SNCF-2015 French signal system</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Signal Masts</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved XSLT display of all elements.</li>
            </ul>

    	<h4>Simple Signal Logic</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved XSLT web display to include sensors</li>
            </ul>

        <a id="Timetable" name="Timetable"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a <strong>Copy Stops</strong> button. This is used to copy the stops for an
            existing train to the new train.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Warrants</h3>
        <a id="Wt" name="Wt"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Additional bug fixing and enhancements to Shared Warrants. SWs are
                useful to animate the simultaneous operation of multiple trains.
                Be aware that SWs may mutually block movement that can only be resolved
                by aborting at least one of them. Regular warrants avoid such deadlocks
                due to the priority of their launch times.
                <ul>
               <li>SWs will not allocate any blocks beyond or at a "hazard" (occupation
                 by foreign train, passage beyond a stop signal, conflict with another
                 warrant)</li>
               <li>If a ramp down to stop at a "hazard" stops before entering the next block,
                   the restart is done automatically when the condition clears.
                   </li>
               <li>If a ramp down to stop at a "hazard" overruns into the next block, the
                   SW will allocate the next block if that is permissible. Whether or not, i.e.
                   the position of the train is marked yellow or blue, use the normal Control
                   commands to restart. "Resume" if the "hazard" was occupation or a warrant,
                   or wait for the signal change to an allowable speed.
                   </li>
                 </ul>
            <li>The messages to the status field of the warrant Table and other information
                can be displayed to the console by clicking the "Trace Warrants" button in
                Warrant Preferences.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Developers: The
                <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Patterns.shtml#typescript">Typescript and Javascript support</a>
                has been updated.</li>
            <li>The included 'ajv' and 'fast-deep-equal' web packages have been updated.</li>
            <li>Improved XSLT display of many elements in panel XML files.</li>
            <li>Remove the <em>Store Only table content (No Panels)...</em> option from the File menu
            used by the PanelPro tables.</li>
            <li>When running the <strong>JmriFaceless</strong> application, the panels (PE/CPE/LE/SE)
            in the xml data file (aka Panel file) are not loaded.</li>
        </ul>
