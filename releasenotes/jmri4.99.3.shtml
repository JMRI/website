      Release Notes for JMRI 4.99.3 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: February 13, 2022</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.99.3 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 4.99.* test releases to migrate JMRI to Java 11.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.0 production release at the end of Spring 2022.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.24, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

            </li>
            <li>SSL (BlockBossLogic) - change to start/stop calls</li>
            <li>Various TrafficManagers.instance methods - use InstanceManager</li>
            <li>Throttle.getListeners() - use getPropertyChangeListeners</li>

    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        The PowerManager now only fires events with the id "power".  Before this
        release, it also fired events with the id "Power". Check that
        your scripting code is looking for the right form.
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This version no longer reads ZeroConf IPv4 and IPv6 preferences
        written with JMRI 4.16 and before.  Please make sure to upgrade
        to JMRI 4.20 (or later) and save your preferences before
        updating to this version if you have configured the WiThrottle preference pane.</li>

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri4.99.2.shtml">Test Release 4.99.2</a>:</h2>

The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=✓&q=milestone%3A4.99.3+is%3Amerged">list of included changes</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.


    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>

        <h4>CBUS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Lawicell devices - added RTR CAN Frame support.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated some new IPL report messages</li>
                <li>Add configuration support for UR93, LNWIs. Allow updates for individual parameters.</li>
            </ul>


        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Lawicell devices - added RTR CAN Frame support.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>RFID</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated: Tags are recorded in a table.
                    If there is a Car (from OperationsPro) associated with this tag,
                    the Road name and Car number are shown. The location and Track are
                    shown in ComboBoxes which the user can set
                    and then click on a button to set to the new Location and Track.
                    Another button shows the Car in the Edit Car window.
                    If there is no associated car, a button opens a window with a list of Road names.
                    The user can select a road name and the second list shows all car numbers for that road.
                    Once a car number has been selected a button sets the tag in that Car.
                    By default the only visible road names and numbers are for cars that do not have a tag.
                    A checkbox shows all cars, including those with tags.
                <p>
                    The window is opened from the "RFID" menu choice (there is one for each RFID connection).
                    The first choice opens the standard Serial Monitor Pane.
                    This new Pane is opened from the second choice.
                    The help screen can be viewed from the monitor pane,
                    or via a link in the Hardware RFID connection frame.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>DecoderPro</h3>
        <a id="DecoderPro" name="DecoderPro"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added accessible names to the (simple)
                variables displayed on programming panes.</li>
            <li>Decoder definitions can now add items to the main programmer-pane window menu.
        </ul>

   <h3>Dispatcher</h3>
        <a id="Dispatcher" name="Dispatcher"></a>
        <ul>
             <li>Fix XCrossings allocation.</li>
             <li>Improve AutoEngineer. Permit unlimited number of Auto Trains.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Layout Editor</h3>
        <a id="LE" name="LE"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the actual turnout state for the turnout circle when that option is used.  This
          corrects the color for turnouts using the continuing route option when set to thrown.</li>

          <li>Tooltip support for panel icons has been changed.
          See <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/display/Tooltips.shtml">
          Tooltips</a> for details.</li>
          <li>Update the layout block occupancy sensor when the occupancy sensor for the related
          block has been added, removed or changed to a different sensor.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>The action <i>Throttle</i> has been updated.
          It now also has the child sockets <i>Function</i>
          and <i>FunctionOnOff</i>. These are optional.
          If both are connected, the Throttle action sets
          or resets this function. The child <i>Function</i>
          tells the function number and the child
          <i>FunctionOnOff</i> tells if the function should
          be On (True) or Off (False).</li>
          <li>A single Logix can be imported to LogixNG. See
          the section <i>Logix</i> for more information.</li>
          <li>The action <i>Local Variable</i> now supports
          <i>Block</i> and <i>Reporter</i>. For <i>Memory</i>,
          <i>Block</i> and <i>Reporter</i>, there is a new
          option <i>Listen</i> that selects whenether the
          action should listen on changes for the <i>Memory</i>,
          <i>Block</i> or <i>Reporter</i>.</li>
          <li>The actions <i>Memory</i> and <i>Local variable</i>
          and the expressions <i>Memory</i> and <i>Local variable</i>
          have improved support for LogixNG Tables.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="PE" name="PE"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>Tooltips can now be edited in Panel Editor.</li>

          <li>Tooltip support for panel icons has been changed.
          See <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/display/Tooltips.shtml">
          Tooltips</a> for details.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Control Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="CPE" name="CPE"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>Tooltip support for panel icons has been changed.
          See <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/display/Tooltips.shtml">
          Tooltips</a> for details.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Preferences</h3>
        <a id="Preferences" name="Preferences"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved handling of the dirty bit, which controls whether you're prompted to save preferences.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Resources</h3>
        <a id="Resources" name="Resources"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Inobu One provided new single-crossover icons and additional double-crossover USS icons.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Switchboard Editor</h3>
        <a id="SW" name="SW"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The menu options to label a switch were enhanced to allow hiding the system name in case a user
              name is configured. This was suggested by Phil-Klein.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Throttle</h3>
        <a id="throttle" name="throttle"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Restored tab and shift+tab shortcuts to browse through throttles inner windows</li>
            <li>Address Panel is now focused as a default when opening a new throttle</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Warrants</h3>
        <a id="Wt" name="Wt"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Additional bug fixing and enhancements to Shared Warrants. SWs are
                useful to animate the simultaneous operation of multiple trains.
                Be aware that SWs may mutually block movement that can only be resolved
                by aborting at least one of them. Regular warrants avoid such deadlocks
                due to the priority of their launch times.
                <ul>
               <li>SWs will not allocate any blocks beyond or at a "hazard" (occupation
                 by foreign train, passage beyond a stop signal, conflict with another
                 warrant)</li>
               <li>If a ramp down to stop at a "hazard" stops before entering the next block,
                   the restart is done automatically when the condition clears.
                   </li>
               <li>If a ramp down to stop at a "hazard" overruns into the next block, the
                   SW will allocate the next block if that is permissible. Whether or not, i.e.
                   the position of the train is marked yellow or blue, use the normal Control
                   commands to restart. "Resume" if the "hazard" was occupation or a warrant,
                   or wait for the signal change to an allowable speed.
                   </li>
                 </ul>
            <li>The messages to the status field of the warrant Table and other information
                can be displayed to the console by clicking the "Trace Warrants" button in
                Warrant Preferences.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>WiThrottle Server</h3>
        <a id="WS" name="WS"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a "TelnetTrain.py" example to run a train from the Python command line.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Web Server</h3>
        <a id="server" name="server"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Support for display and interaction with (Control) Panel slipTurnoutIcons has been added
            to JMRI Web Server Panels.<br>
            This includes double and single slips, three-way turnouts and scissors with 2 or 4 turnouts.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved accessibility of throttle keyboard shortcut help.</li>
            <li>Developers: The
                <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/Patterns.shtml#typescript">Typescript and Javascript support</a>
                has been updated.</li>
        </ul>
