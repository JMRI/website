	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.5.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.6 production release around the end of the year.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 3.5.1:</h3>

   <p>Matthew Harris:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Updated the InstallTest batch file to pause before exiting
      in certain situations on 64-bit versions of Windows.</li>
   <li>Update logging behaviour to create individual per-session 
       log files (session.log) and to collate several session log
       files into messages.log</li>
   </ul>
   
   <ul>
    <li>Add the ability to delay the re-allocation of sections for a train set with continuous running.  The delay can be set as either a duration in minutes or triggered by a sensor. - KD</li>
   </ul>
   
   <P>The CV table in DecoderPro is now sortable and by default appears in order by number.
   
      <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The Yardmaster window now has a "Next" button which allows the window to be used with
     the JMRI web server. The drop down menus unfortunately don't work when using a browser to
     access the windows remotely.</li>
    <li>Improved the Conductor and Yardmaster window layouts.</li>
    <li>Fixed the "Exclude" option in the Destination window for classification/interchange
     tracks.</li>
    <li>Fixed the "All Trains" feature when using consolidation mode in switch lists.</li>
    <li>Fixed the "Return when Empty" when a car entered staging with a custom load, and the
     remove custom loads option was enabled.</li>
    <li>Fixed a problem with the train manifest showing the wrong number of utility cars for
     pickups. Thanks to Joe Mattick for bring this to our attention.
   </ul>

   <p>Ken Cameron made the following changes:</p>
   <ul>
   	<li>Added code to prevent bad programming track writing to CV's greater than 255 which are not supported
   		by the PowerHouse command station. Using the ops mode works as well as the PowerCab with the whole 1024 range.
	</li>
	<li>Fixed wrong properties name in USB Interface panel.</li>
   </ul>
