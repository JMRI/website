      Release Notes for JMRI 4.99.6 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: April 15, 2022</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.99.6 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 4.99.* test releases to migrate JMRI to Java 11.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.0 production release at the end of Spring 2022.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.24, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri4.26.shtml#warnings">JMRI 4.26 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 4.99 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.2.shtml">JMRI 4.99.2</a></span>

        an update to any start-up actions that reference their location.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/JVMCapabilities.shtml">JVM Capabilities</a> pages.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        A number of classes and methods that have been deprecated for a long time
        are removed in this release.  These include:
        <ul>
            <li>apps.JmriPlugin</li>
            <li>apps/startup/StartupActionFactory</li>
            <li>Routes/Turnouts/Sensors: One form of getNextAddress</li>
            <li>Handling of preferences from before JMRI 4.0; upgrade through JMRI 4.20 instead</li>
            <li>ShutDownTask, AbstractShutDownTask - use call & run methods now</li>
            <li>Removed JythonAutomaton, JythonAutomatonAction, JythonSiglet, JythonSigletAction
                unused classes.  These have been made obsolete by JMRI's native scripting,
                and haven't been used since JMRI 1.2
            </li>
            <li>SSL (BlockBossLogic) - change to start/stop calls</li>
            <li>Various TrafficManagers.instance methods - use InstanceManager</li>
            <li>Throttle.getListeners() - use getPropertyChangeListeners</li>
            <li>Removed obsolete RosterRecorder class;
                function now available via scripting
            </li>
            <li>Removed deprecated methods from Throttle panels</li>
            <li>Manager.getSystemNameList - rework with getNamedBeanSet</li>
            <li>Manager.getNamedBeanList - rework with getNamedBeanSet</li>
            <li>Manager.setPropertyChangesMuted - use setPropertyChangesSilenced</li>
            <li>Manager.getBeanBySystemName - use getBySystemName</li>
            <li>Manager.getBeanByUserName - use getByUserName</li>
            <li>FileChooserUtil</li>
            <li>get/setFontFamily in SystemConsolePreferencesManager</li>
            <li>throttle.FunctionPanel#changeState(..) has been replaced by #setSelected(..)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        The PowerManager now only fires events with the id "power".  Before this
        release, it also fired events with the id "Power". Check that
        your scripting code is looking for the right form.
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This version no longer reads ZeroConf IPv4 and IPv6 preferences
        written with JMRI 4.16 and before.  Please make sure to upgrade
        to JMRI 4.20 (or later) and save your preferences before
        updating to this version if you have configured the WiThrottle preference pane.</li>
