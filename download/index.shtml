    This page describes JMRI releases.  Briefly, we have three kinds:
    <ul>
    <li>"<a href="#prod-rel">Production releases</a>" about twice a year.  These are the ones we recommend to general users.
    <li>"<a href="#test-rel">Test releases</a>", usually <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones">about monthly</a>.
        These contain new features and changes that will eventually appear in the next production release.
    <li>Development builds, which are created every few hours as the 
        developers update the code. You can 
        <a href="http://jmri.tagadab.com/jenkins/job/Development/job/Packages/">download one of these</a>
        if you want quick access to some particular fix, but please note that they're
        not fully tested. Test releases get more testing as part of the release process.
    </ul>

    <h2>JMRI - Test Releases</h2>
    <p>As the program develops, we also produce test releases. You may
	    want to try these, as new features will show up in them first. They
	    are announced in the
	    <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jmriusers/info">JMRI users</a> Yahoo group.</p>
    <p>
        The most current test release is JMRI 4.9.4.  More information on it, 
        including the links to download a copy, can be found in
        <a href="../releasenotes/jmri4.9.4.shtml">release note</a>.
	<p>
	   For more information on the rough development schedule, please see the 
	   <a href="../help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI road map</a>
