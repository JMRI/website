      <p>This pane is opened from the button the DecoderPro3 main window.</p>

      <p>This pane is more than a scratch pad to keep track of what happens when function buttons
      are pushed. It also interacts with the <a href="dp3_Main_Throttle.shtml">JMRI
      throttle</a>.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Function Label</strong>s Tab makes settings for the Software Throttles within
      JMRI. Primarily the on-screen throttles, but some of the settings are mirrored on
      smart-phones (iPhone/Android) using the WiThrottle interface.</p>

      <p>When you use the roster pull-down on the JMRI throttle to select a loco from your roster,
      the function buttons will be marked with the descriptions you have entered for those
      functions in this pane.</p>

      <p>In this example, the Function keys on the T hrottle will be labeled for the locomotives
      sounds and lighting functions.</p>

      <p class="dp-center"><img src="images/Adv_03_FunctionLabels.png" width="920" height="568"
      alt="function labels">
      </p>

      <p>Using the checkboxes, space holders and the radio button to the right of each function may
      be set to:</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>lock</strong>
          </td>
          <td>
            <p>Makes the function button "latching" or "non-latching". When the box is checked the
            function is "locked" or "latched".</p>

            <p><strong>Latched Function</strong> when pressed will stay on(down position) until
            pressed again i.e. Function button labeled "Bell" would ring until pressed again.</p>

            <p><strong>Unlatched Function</strong> when pressed toggles on and then off. i.e.
            Function Button labled "short horn", when pressed provides one blast of horn.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><strong>off</strong>
          </td>
          <td>Place holder for icon that is displayed on Function Button when it is in off
          state.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><strong>on</strong>
          </td>
          <td>Place holder for icon that is displayed on Function Button when it is in on
          state.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><strong>shunt</strong>
          </td>
          <td>Sets "virtual" funtion key for software throttle. The "lock" option also needs to be
          set simultaneously with the "shunt" virtual function key activation. When this Function
          key is pressed the throttle speed slider on the software throttle changes to "center off"
          style for shunting, rather than the "full-range with separate direction key"</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>You may drag and drop icons into the off or on space holder here or in the Throttle
      Function pane properties.</p>

      <p>You may also edit the function button text in the <strong><a href=
      "dp3_Main_Throttle.shtml">JMRI Throttle</a></strong> and save those changes to the selected
      Roster entry. To use these changed entries in the future, make sure you click on the
      <input type="submit" name="button" id="button" value="Save to Roster"> to save these values
      into the Roster entry that is in use.</p>
